Invention of the Modern Cookbook,Sandra Sherman,Bloomsbury Publishing USA,2010-04-15,"This eye-opening history will change the way you read a cookbook or regard a TV chef, making cooking ventures vastly more interesting—and a lot more fun. Every kitchen has at least one well-worn cookbook, but just how did they come to be? Invention of the Modern Cookbook is the first study to examine that question, discussing the roots of these collections in 17th-century England and illuminating the cookbook's role as it has evolved over time. Readers will discover that cookbooks were the product of careful invention by highly skilled chefs and profit-minded publishers who designed them for maximum audience appeal, responding to a changing readership and cultural conditions and utilizing innovative marketing and promotion techniques still practiced today. They will see how cookbooks helped women adjust to the changes of the Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution by educating them on a range of subjects from etiquette to dealing with household servants. And they will learn how the books themselves became ""modern,"" taking on the characteristics we now take for granted.",N/A,9798216104636,381,Cooking,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-qz2EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=-qz2EAAAQBAJ&pg=PT299&dq=Cookbooks&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-qz2EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

In Kentucky's Cookbook Heritage, John van Willigen explores the Bluegrass State's cultural and culinary history, through the rich material found in regional cookbooks.

Van Willigen also shares the story of the original Aunt Jemima—the advertising persona of Nancy Green, born in Montgomery County, Kentucky—who was one of many African American voices in Kentucky culinary history. Kentucky's Cookbook Heritage is a journey through the history of the commonwealth, showcasing the shifting attitudes and innovations of the times.

Cookbook Politics,Kennan Ferguson,University of Pennsylvania Press,2020-05-29,"An original and eclectic view of cookbooks as political acts Cookbooks are not political in conventional ways. They neither proclaim, as do manifestos, nor do they forbid, as do laws. They do not command agreement, as do arguments, and their stipulations often lack specificity — cook ""until browned."" Yet, as repositories of human taste, cookbooks transmit specific blends of flavor, texture, and nutrition across space and time. Cookbooks both form and reflect who we are. In Cookbook Politics, Kennan Ferguson explores the sensual and political implications of these repositories, demonstrating how they create nations, establish ideologies, shape international relations, and structure communities. Cookbook Politics argues that cookbooks highlight aspects of our lives we rarely recognize as political—taste, production, domesticity, collectivity, and imagination—and considers the ways in which cookbooks have or do politics, from the most overt to the most subtle. Cookbooks turn regional diversity into national unity, as Pellegrino Artusi's Science in the Kitchen and the Art of Eating Well did for Italy in 1891. Politically affiliated organizations compile and sell cookbooks—for example, the early United Nations published The World's Favorite Recipes. From the First Baptist Church of Midland, Tennessee's community cookbook, to Julia Child's Mastering the Art of French Cooking, to the Italian Futurists' proto-fascist guide to food preparation, Ferguson demonstrates how cookbooks mark desires and reveal social commitments: your table becomes a representation of who you are. Authoritative, yet flexible; collective, yet individualized; cooperative, yet personal—cookbooks invite participation, editing, and transformation. Created to convey flavor and taste across generations, communities, and nations, they enact the continuities and changes of social lives. Their functioning in the name of creativity and preparation—with readers happily consuming them in similar ways—makes cookbooks an exemplary model for democratic politics.",0812252268,9780812252262,160,Political Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HRjdDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=HRjdDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA13&dq=Cookbooks&hl=&cd=11&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=HRjdDwAAQBAJ&dq=Cookbooks&hl=&source=gbs_api

Liberty profile provides a convenient and capable platform for developing and testing your web and OSGi applications. The Liberty profile server is built by using OSGi technology and concepts. The fit-for-purpose nature of the run time relies on the dynamic behavior that is inherent in the OSGi framework and service registry. As bundles are installed or uninstalled from the framework, their services are automatically added or removed from the service registry. The result is a dynamic, composable run time that can be provisioned with only what your application requires and responds dynamically to configuration changes as your application evolves. This book can help you install, customize, and configure several popular open source technologies that can be deployed effectively with the Liberty profile server.

Reading Notes,Dirk Van Hulle,Rodopi,2004,"Reading notes constitute a vast resource for an understanding of literary history and culture. They indicate what writers read as well as how they read and what they used in their own work. As such, they play an important role in both the reception and the production of texts. The essays in this volume, representing the newest trends in European and international textual scholarship, examine literary creation and the relationship between reading and writing. To study how readers respond to writing and how reading engenders new writing, the contributing scholars no longer take for granted that authors write in splendid isolation, but turn to a more broadly sociological investigation of authorship, assigning new roles to the writer as reader, notetaker, annotator, book collector and so on. Notes and annotations may be fragmentary, private, undigested and embryonic, but as witnesses to the reading process, they tell unique stories about writers and readers, ranging from great marginalists like Coleridge to women annotators of cookbooks. This subject of research is a junction of several fields of research and tries to bridge gaps between separate disciplines with a common ground, such as the history of the book, the history of reading, and the history of writing, scholarly editing, and textual genetics (the analysis, commentary and critical interpretation of the way in which works of art come into being), bridging the gap between literary and textual criticism.",9042018216,9789042018211,432,Language Arts & Disciplines,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RhM_siG8AloC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=RhM_siG8AloC&pg=PA96&dq=Cookbooks&hl=&cd=19&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RhM_siG8AloC&source=gbs_api

Pollard examine texts that vary from historical to contemporary, noncanonical to classics, and Anglo-American to multicultural traditions, including a variety of genres, formats, and audiences: realism, fantasy, cookbooks, picture books, chapter books, YA novels, and film. Table Lands offers a unified approach to studying food in a wide variety of texts for children. Spanning nearly 150 years of children’s literature, Keeling and Pollard’s analysis covers a selection of texts that show the omnipresence of food in children’s literature and culture and how they vary in representations of race, region, and class, due to the impact of these issues on food. Furthermore, they include not only classic children’s books, such as Winnie-the-Pooh, but recent award-winning multicultural novels as well as cookbooks and even one film, Pixar’s Ratatouille.",1496828380,9781496828385,218,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=49LgDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=49LgDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA12&dq=Cookbooks&hl=&cd=20&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=49LgDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api
Queering Nutrition and Dietetics,"Phillip Joy, Megan Aston",Taylor & Francis,2022-10-28,"This book presents experiences of LGBTQ+ people relating to food, bodies, nutrition, health, wellbeing, and being queer through critical writing and creative art. The chapters bring LGBTQ+ voices into the spotlight through arts-based scholarship and contribute to experiential learning, allowing for more understanding of the lives of LGBTQ+ people within the dietetic profession. Divided into three parts, the first explores eating, food, and bodies; the second discusses communities, connections, and celebrations; and the final part covers care in practice. Topics include body image, eating disorders, weight stigma, cooking and culinary journeys, queer food culture, queer practices in nutrition counseling, and gendered understandings of nutrition. Exploring not only experiences of marginalization, homophobia, transphobia, and cisheteronormativity within dietetics and nutritional healthcare, this collection also dives into the positive connections and supportive communities that food can create. Special attention is paid to the intersections of oppression, colonialism, social justice, and politics.

It engages with a range of historical perspectives on each city’s food and culinary histories, including colonial culinary legacies, restaurants, cafes, street food, market gardens, supermarkets and cookbooks, examining the exchange of goods and services and how the migration of people to the urban centres informed the social histories of the cities’ foodways in the contexts of culinary nationalism, ethnic identities and globalization. Considering the recent food history of the three cities and its complex narrative of empire, trade networks and migration patterns, this book discusses key aspects of each city’s cuisine in the twentieth century, examining the interwoven threads of colonialism and globalization. ​",1137516917,9781137516916,259,Social Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OwGQDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=OwGQDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA203&dq=Cookbooks&hl=&cd=23&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OwGQDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

The Oxford Companion to American Food and Drink,Andrew F. Smith,Oxford University Press,2007-05,"Offering a panoramic view of the history and culture of food and drink in America with fascinating entries on everything from the smell of asparagus to the history of White Castle, and the origin of Bloody Marys to jambalaya, the Oxford Companion to American Food and Drink provides a concise, authoritative, and exuberant look at this modern American obsession. Ideal for the food scholar and food enthusiast alike, it is equally appetizing for anyone fascinated by Americana, capturing our culture and history through what we love most--food!Building on the highly praised and deliciously browseable two-volume compendium the Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America, this new work serves up everything you could ever want to know about American consumables and their impact on popular culture and the culinary world. Within its pages for example, we learn that Lifesavers candy owes its success to the canny marketing idea of placing the original flavor, mint, next to cash registers at bars. Patrons who bought them to mask the smell of alcohol on their breath before heading home soon found they were just as tasty sober and the company began producing other flavors.Edited by Andrew Smith, a writer and lecturer on culinary history, the Companion serves up more than just trivia however, including hundreds of entries on fast food, celebrity chefs, fish, sandwiches, regional and ethnic cuisine, food science, and historical food traditions. It also dispels a few commonly held myths. Veganism, isn't simply the practice of a few ""hippies,"" but is in fact wide-spread among elite athletic circles. Many of the top competitors in the Ironman and Ultramarathon events go even further, avoiding all animal products by following a strictly vegan diet. Anyone hungering to know what our nation has been cooking and eating for the last three centuries should own the Oxford Companion to American Food and Drink.

The No Recipe Cookbook,Susan Crowther,Simon and Schuster,2013-07-01,"What has happened to cooking? Where has it gone? For most people, it is left to the experts in restaurants and on television. Thanks to the constant availability of takeout, frozen dinners, and fast food restaurants, for the majority of Americans, cooking has become a spectator sport—an entertaining activity you watch on television, but not something to try at home. The No Recipe Cookbook is a warm and funny instructional guide that addresses this issue head-on. Rather than simply collecting recipes, author, chef, caterer, and nutritionist Susan Crowther offers people something even more useful—an understanding of how to cook. The No Recipe Cookbook is a commonsensical and creative approach to preparing delicious meals, focusing on principles, intuition, and integrity. Cooking is also explored holistically, incorporating aspects such as local ingredients and “green cooking.” Each page explores culinary virtues of patience, adaptability, and love next to principles, utensils, and procedures. From preparing simple salad dressings to simmering soup stocks to kneading dough for bread, Crowther takes the intimidation factor out of cooking by giving readers the basic information and tools they need for culinary success. Once you understand a few basic rules and generally what ingredients in what proportions are necessary for certain dishes, you’ll be free to confidently experiment with all sorts of culinary creations. With a handful of easy-to-follow cooking time charts and shopping lists, plenty of warm advice, and a pinch of humor, Crowther welcomes aspiring cooks on a fun and exciting culinary adventure.",1626363323,9781626363328,246,Cooking,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mHGCDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=mHGCDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT21&dq=Cookbooks&hl=&cd=29&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mHGCDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Food and Drink in American History,Andrew F. Smith,Bloomsbury Publishing USA,2013-10-28,"This three-volume encyclopedia on the history of American food and beverages serves as an ideal companion resource for social studies and American history courses, covering topics ranging from early American Indian foods to mandatory nutrition information at fast food restaurants. The expression ""you are what you eat"" certainly applies to Americans, not just in terms of our physical health, but also in the myriad ways that our taste preferences, eating habits, and food culture are intrinsically tied to our society and history. This standout reference work comprises two volumes containing more than 600 alphabetically arranged historical entries on American foods and beverages, as well as dozens of historical recipes for traditional American foods; and a third volume of more than 120 primary source documents. Never before has there been a reference work that coalesces this diverse range of information into a single set. The entries in this set provide information that will transform any American history research project into an engaging learning experience. Examples include explanations of how tuna fish became a staple food product for Americans, how the canning industry emerged from the Civil War, the difference between Americans and people of other countries in terms of what percentage of their income is spent on food and beverages, and how taxation on beverages like tea, rum, and whisky set off important political rebellions in U.S. history.",1610692330,9781610692335,1715,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lxjOEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=lxjOEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA227&dq=Cookbooks&hl=&cd=31&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lxjOEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api
Local Theories of Argument,Dale Hample,Routledge,2021-03-25,"Argumentation is often understood as a coherent set of Western theories, birthed in Athens and developing throughout the Roman period, the Middle Ages, the Enlightenment and Renaissance, and into the present century. Ideas have been nuanced, developed, and revised, but still the outline of argumentation theory has been recognizable for centuries, or so it has seemed to Western scholars. The 2019 Alta Conference on Argumentation (co-sponsored by the National Communication Association and the American Forensic Association) aimed to question the generality of these intellectual traditions. This resulting collection of essays deals with the possibility of having local theories of argument – local to a particular time, a particular kind of issue, a particular place, or a particular culture. Many of the papers argue for reconsidering basic ideas about arguing to represent the uniqueness of some moment or location of discourse. Other scholars are more comfortable with the Western traditions, and find them congenial to the analysis of arguments that originate in discernibly distinct circumstances. The papers represent different methodologies, cover the experiences of different nations at different times, examine varying sorts of argumentative events (speeches, court decisions, food choices, and sound), explore particular personal identities and the issues highlighted by them, and have different overall orientations to doing argumentation scholarship. Considered together, the essays do not generate one simple conclusion, but they stimulate reflection about the particularity or generality of the experience of arguing, and therefore the scope of our theories.",1000361640,9781000361643,559,Language Arts & Disciplines,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bHwSEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=bHwSEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA394&dq=Cookbooks&hl=&cd=32&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bHwSEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api
Danish Cookbooks,Carol Gold,Museum Tusculanum Press,2007,"Cookbooks tell stories. They open up the worlds in which the people who wrote and read them once lived. In the hands of a good historian, cookbooks can be shown to contain the markings of political, social, and ideological changes that we conventionally locate outside the kitchen. Cookbooks allow us to trace the course of empires, of social roles, and of new nations over time. DANISH COOKBOOKS draws from three hundred years of Danish cookbooks to trace the growth of a bourgeois consciousness, the development of domesticity and gendered spheres, and the evolution of nationalism and a specific Danish identity from the early seventeenth to the beginning of the twentieth century. Like all prescriptive literature, cookbooks do not merely reflect the changes of the day but also constitute them. Historian Carol Gold reads recipes and cooking instructions for what they can tell us about literacy levels, division of labour in the kitchen and in society, and changes in the gendered aspects of publishing and using cookbooks. Gold explores the authors' instructions for economic and hygienic housekeeping and their sentiments about Danish identity as spelled out in dishes and spices. Just as the Danish nation would manage the body politic, so women were exhorted to manage the house and ensure the family's physical and moral health. Through the pages of cookbooks -- in recipes, menus, and table settings -- we can chart the growth of a nationalist Denmark and track the development of what it means to be a Dane. Written with the ease of a veteran historian and in an accessible and engaging style, DANISH COOKBOOKS will appeal to scholars in Scandinavian studies as well as in gender and women's studies. It will also appeal to non-academic readers interested in historical aspects of Danish nationalism and identity, women's social history, and cookbooks and cooking.",8763506084,9788763506083,236,Cooking,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7iBswHjowWQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=7iBswHjowWQC&pg=PA20&dq=Cookbooks&hl=&cd=33&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=7iBswHjowWQC&dq=Cookbooks&hl=&source=gbs_api

It investigates whether these resources genuinely shape what we eat, or if our reliance on familiar recipes overshadows their impact. Intriguingly, the book reveals that many people collect recipes without fully utilizing them, highlighting a gap between aspiration and practice. It also examines how cultural trends and technology, like online platforms, are reshaping recipe consumption in the food industry. The book presents a data-driven analysis of consumer cooking surveys, providing insights into recipe usage, preferred formats, and self-reported culinary skills. It also considers demographic factors like age and income, and their effects on meal planning decisions. By tracing the history of cookbooks and food media, the book challenges common assumptions about the effectiveness of cooking guides. Divided into three main sections, the book progresses from analyzing consumer survey data to exploring demographic influences and examining the impact of online platforms. Ultimately, it offers strategies for enhancing the relevance and usability of cooking guides, providing valuable recommendations for recipe developers, food educators, and policymakers.

Prairie Avenue Cookbook,Carol Callahan,SIU Press,1993,"This enchanting cookbook by Carol Callahan allows us to reverse time and transcend space in order to enter a period and place in American history when confidence abounded and all things seemed possible and some Chicago families were able to live in a manner never to be equaled. Judge for yourself. The thirty-five illustrations that accompany the text document what a grand life-style it was. ""If you want to see the richest half-dozen blocks in Chicago. . . drive down Prairie Avenue from Sixteenth Street to Twenty-second. Right there is a cluster of millionaires not to be matched for numbers anywhere else in the country."" -- Chicago Herald, 1887 And the Herald wasn't guilty of braggadocio. Prairie Avenue was home to such august individuals as Marshall Field, George Pullman, Philip Armour, Gustavus Swift, William Kimball, Samuel Allerton, Joseph Sears, and John Glessner. Among the delights they enjoyed were the joys of the table-- the recipes for which, preserved by family members, are shared here for the first time. Carol Callahan makes it possible to taste the flavors of that opulent era with a collection of more than two hundred historic recipes from the prominent nineteenth-century families of Prairie Avenue. All of the recipes have been tested and modernized for today's cook. They range from everything you might like for breakfast to however you' d like your oysters to snacks, soups, salads, entré es, preserves, desserts, and some power-packed Prairie Avenue party punches. To place these dishes in their proper context, Callahan includes family anecdotes gathered through oral history interviews that encompass food, meals, health, and entertainment as well as other aspects of nineteenth-century Chicago life. Callahan devotes part of the book to discussions of the foods available to Prairie Avenue residents, the impact of the rapidly changing technology on cooking, the fine art of dining, the ritual of calling, the problems and pleasures of servants in the household, the children of Prairie Avenue, and the effect of the 1893 World's Colombian Exposition on Chicago. Whether you elect to prepare these Victorian delights or simply savor them in your imagination, the Prairie Avenue Cookbook is sumptuous fare.",0809318148,9780809318148,240,Cooking,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iMv3rB21A8QC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=iMv3rB21A8QC&pg=PA15&dq=Cookbooks&hl=&cd=44&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=iMv3rB21A8QC&dq=Cookbooks&hl=&source=gbs_api

Cook This Book,Molly Baz,Clarkson Potter,2021-04-20,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • A thoroughly modern guide to becoming a better, faster, more creative cook, featuring fun, flavorful recipes anyone can make. ONE OF THE BEST COOKBOOKS OF THE YEAR: NPR, Food52, Taste of Home “Surprising no one, Molly has written a book as smart, stylish, and entertaining as she is.”—Carla Lalli Music, author of Where Cooking Begins If you seek out, celebrate, and obsess over good food but lack the skills and confidence necessary to make it at home, you’ve just won a ticket to a life filled with supreme deliciousness. Cook This Book is a new kind of foundational cookbook from Molly Baz, who’s here to teach you absolutely everything she knows and equip you with the tools to become a better, more efficient cook. Molly breaks the essentials of cooking down to clear and uncomplicated recipes that deliver big flavor with little effort and a side of education, including dishes like Pastrami Roast Chicken with Schmaltzy Onions and Dill, Chorizo and Chickpea Carbonara, and of course, her signature Cae Sal. But this is not your average cookbook. More than a collection of recipes, Cook This Book teaches you the invaluable superpower of improvisation though visually compelling lessons on such topics as the importance of salt and how to balance flavor, giving you all the tools necessary to make food taste great every time. Throughout, you’ll encounter dozens of QR codes, accessed through the camera app on your smartphone, that link to short technique-driven videos hosted by Molly to help illuminate some of the trickier skills. As Molly says, “Cooking is really fun, I swear. You simply need to set yourself up for success to truly enjoy it.” Cook This Book will help you do just that, inspiring a new generation to find joy in the kitchen and take pride in putting a home-cooked meal on the table, all with the unbridled fun and spirit that only Molly could inspire.",0593138279,9780593138274,306,Cooking,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8UUlEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,5,1,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=8UUlEAAAQBAJ&dq=Cookbooks&hl=&cd=69&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=8UUlEAAAQBAJ&dq=Cookbooks&hl=&source=gbs_api

Latino Food Culture,Zilkia Janer,Greenwood,2008-03-30,"Latino cuisine has always been a part of American foodways, but the recent growth of a diverse Latino population in the form of documented and undocumented immigrants, refugees, and exiles has given rise to a pan-Latino food phenomenon. These various food cultures in the United States are expertly overviewed here together in depth for the first time. Many Mexican American, Cuban American, Puerto Ricans, Dominican American, and Central and South American communities in the United States are considered transnational because they actively participate in the economy, politics, and culture of both the United States and their countries of origin. The pan-Latino food culture that is emerging in the United States is also a transnational phenomenon that constantly nurtures and is nurtured by national and regional cuisines. They all combine in kaleidoscopic ways their shared gastronomic wealth of Spanish and Amerindian cuisines with different African, European and Asian culinary traditions. This book discusses the ongoing development of Latino food culture, giving special attention to how Latinos are adapting and transforming Latin American and international elements to create one of the most vibrant cuisines today. This is essential reading for crucial cultural insight into Latinos from all backgrounds. Readers will learn about the diverse elements of an evolving pan-Latino food culture-the history of the various groups and their foodstuffs, cooking, meals and eating habits, special occasions, and diet and health. Representative recipes and photos are interspersed in the essays. A chronology, glossary, resource guide, and bibliography make this a one-stop resource for every library.",N/A,N/A,222,Cooking,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DJIgAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=DJIgAQAAIAAJ&q=Cookbooks&dq=Cookbooks&hl=&cd=95&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=DJIgAQAAIAAJ&dq=Cookbooks&hl=&source=gbs_api

The Recipe Reader,"Janet Floyd, Laurel Forster",Routledge,2003,"Over the last decade there has been an intense and widespread interest in the writing and publishing of cookery books; yet there remains surprisingly little contextualized analysis of the recipe as a generic form. This essay collection asserts that the recipe in all its cultural and textual contexts - from the quintessential embodiment of lifestyle choices to the reflection of artistic aspiration - is a complex, distinct and important form of cultural expression. In this volume, contributors address questions raised by the recipe, its context, its cultural moment and mode of expression. Examples are drawn from such diverse areas as: nineteenth and twentieth-century private publications, official government documents, campaigning literature, magazines, and fictions as well as cookery writers themselves, cookbooks and TV cookery. In subjecting the recipe to close critical analysis, The Recipe Reader serves to move the study of this cultural form forward. It will interest scholars of literature, popular culture, social history and women's studies as well as food historians and professional food writers. Written in an accessible style, this collection of essays expands the range of writers under consideration, and brings new perspectives, contexts and arguments into the existing field of debate about cookery writing.",N/A,N/A,264,Cooking,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PtzYAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=PtzYAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA35&dq=Cookbooks&hl=&cd=120&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=PtzYAAAAMAAJ&dq=Cookbooks&hl=&source=gbs_api

A History of Cookbooks,Henry Notaker,Univ of California Press,2017-09-05,"A History of Cookbooks provides a sweeping literary and historical overview of the cookbook genre, exploring its development as a part of food culture beginning in the Late Middle Ages. Studying cookbooks from various Western cultures and languages, Henry Notaker traces the transformation of recipes from brief notes with ingredients into detailed recipes with a specific structure, grammar, and vocabulary. In addition, he reveals that cookbooks go far beyond offering recipes: they tell us a great deal about nutrition, morals, manners, history, and menus while often providing entertaining reflections and commentaries. This innovative book demonstrates that cookbooks represent an interesting and important branch of nonfiction literature.",0520967283,9780520967281,401,Cooking,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RywtDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=RywtDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Cookbooks&hl=&cd=168&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RywtDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

The American Century Cookbook,Jean Anderson,N/A,1997,"For the past ten years, Jean Anderson has been on a quest: to search out the most popular recipes of the 20th century and to chronicle 100 years of culinary change in America. The result is a rich and fascinating look at where we've been, at the recipes our mothers and grandmothers loved, and at how our own tastes have evolved. The more than 500 cherished recipes in these pages are mainstays of American home cooking, the recipes that have remained favorites year after year. For the smallest sampling: California dip . . . Buffalo chicken wings . . . vichyssoise . . . tuna-noodle casserole . . . Swiss steak . . . frosted meat loaf . . . tamale pie . . . corn dogs . . . lobster rolls . . . classic green bean bake . . . perfection salad . . . green goddess salad . . . frozen fruit salad . . . chiffon cake . . . brownies . . . chocolate chip cookies . . . chocolate decadence Beyond this collection is Jean's exploration of the diversity of our nation's cuisine and our adoption of such ""foreign"" dishes as pizza, gazpacho, lasagne, moussaka, and tarte tatin. Her painstakingly researched text includes extensive headnotes, thumbnail profiles of important people and products (from Fannie Farmer to James Beard and from electric refrigerators to the microwave), and a timeline of major 20th-century food firsts. In recording popular recipes that might have been lost, in setting them in richly detailed historical context, Jean Anderson has written her masterwork. The American Century Cookbook may well be the most important new cookbook of the decade; it is certainly the book America will love.",N/A,N/A,568,Cooking,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0pcsAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=0pcsAAAAYAAJ&q=Cookbooks&dq=Cookbooks&hl=&cd=180&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=0pcsAAAAYAAJ&dq=Cookbooks&hl=&source=gbs_api

Le Bernardin Cookbook,"Eric Ripert, Maguy Le Coze",Clarkson Potter,2014-06-25,"Cusine from New York's four-star seafood restaurant, Le Bernardin, is made accessible to everyone in more than 100 meticulously formulated and carefully tested recipes for all courses, from appetizers through dessert, in this cookbook from Le Bernardin chef Eric Ripert and owner Maguy Le Coze. The food served in Le Bernardin's beautiful dining room is as subtle and refined as any in the world, and because fish and shellfish are often best turned out quickly and simply, the recipes in this book can be reproduced by any home cook. Maguy Le Coze traces the origins of Le Bernardin's ""simplicity"" to her late brother, Gilbert, the restaurant's legendary cofounder and first chef. Today, Chef Eric Ripert carries on Gilbert's simplistic tradition with dishes such as Poached Halibut on Marinated Vegetables, Pan-Roasted Grouper with Wild Mushrooms and Artichokes, and Grilled Salmon with Mushroom Vinaigrette. And, of course, there are the desserts for which Le Bernardin is also so well known--from Chocolate Millefeuille to Honeyed Pear and Almond Cream Tarts. Essential to the experience of dining at Le Bernardin and to the Le Bernardin Cookbook are the dynamic and charming personalities of Maguy Le Coze and Eric Ripert, whose lively dialogue and colorful anecdotes shine from these pages as brightly as the recipes themselves.",0553419129,9780553419122,452,Cooking,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VOhuAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=VOhuAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Cookbooks&hl=&cd=216&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VOhuAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Shakespeare's Kitchen,Francine Segan,Random House,2011-10-05,"“Shakespeare’s Kitchen not only reveals, sometimes surprisingly, what people were eating in Shakespeare’s time but also provides recipes that today’s cooks can easily re-create with readily available ingredients.” —from the Foreword by Patrick O’Connell Francine Segan introduces contemporary cooks to the foods of William Shakespeare’ s world with recipes updated from classic sixteenth- and seventeenth-century cookbooks. Her easy-to-prepare adaptations shatter the myth that the Bard’s primary fare was boiled mutton. In fact, Shakespeare and his contemporaries dined on salads of fresh herbs and vegetables; fish, fowl, and meats of all kinds; and delicate broths. Dried Plums with Wine and Ginger-Zest Crostini, Winter Salad with Raisin and Caper Vinaigrette, and Lobster with Pistachio Stuffing and Seville Orange Butter are just a few of the delicious, aromatic, and gorgeous dishes that will surprise and delight. Segan’s delicate and careful renditions of these recipes have been thoroughly tested to ensure no-fail, standout results. The tantalizing Renaissance recipes in Shakespeare’s Kitchen are enhanced with food-related quotes from the Bard, delightful morsels of culinary history, interesting facts on the customs and social etiquette of Shakespeare’ s time, and the texts of the original recipes, complete with antiquated spellings and eccentric directions. Patrick O’Connell provides an enticing Foreword to this edible history from which food lovers and Shakespeare enthusiasts alike will derive nourishment. Want something new for dinner? Try something four hundred years old.

The Carnivore Cookbook,Maria Emmerich,Victory Belt Publishing,2020-01-07,"Keto meets carnivore in this revolutionary new book by revered cookbook author and low-carb pioneer Maria Emmerich. Did you know that our ancestors were apex predators who were even more carnivorous than hyenas and big cats? That was only about 30,000 years ago. But since then, our diets have drastically changed due to the invention of agriculture about 7,000 years ago and, within the last 100 years or so, the introduction of millions of food additives, the development of a year-round produce supply, and the hybridization of fruits and vegetables, making them higher in sugar and lower in nutrients. The Carnivore Cookbook explores what our bodies were really designed to digest and gives compelling evidence that we were designed to be primarily meat-eaters. In this book, you will learn why all plants come with a downside. Antinutrients are chemicals and compounds that act as natural pesticides or defenses for the plants against being eaten. Maria explains how antinutrients can rob your body of minerals and other nutrients and lead to autoimmune issues and leaky gut. There is even a protocol for healing autoimmune issues called the Carnivore Autoimmune Protocol: a detailed system for stepping you through the various levels of carnivorous eating to find the point where your body responds best and is symptom free. You will also learn which foods are the highest in nutrient density to help your body heal. The Carnivore Cookbook includes more than 100 tasty meat-focused recipes featuring innovative ways to add flavor and variety. There are even carnivore meal plans with grocery lists to make the diet easy to follow.",1628602384,9781628602388,538,Health & Fitness,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Aqh3EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=Aqh3EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Cookbooks&hl=&cd=229&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Aqh3EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Classico e Moderno,"Michael White, Andrew Friedman",Ballantine Books,2013-11-05,"NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY PUBLISHERS WEEKLY Having won or been nominated for just about every known prestigious culinary award, Michael White is hailed by food critics as the next great hero of Italian gastronomy. His reach extends around the globe with a clutch of acclaimed fine dining restaurants, including Marea, Ai Fiori, Osteria Morini, and pizzeria Nicoletta. Now, in Classico e Moderno, White brings his passion for authentic Italian cuisine to the home kitchen, with recipes—nearly 250—that cover both the traditional and contemporary dishes of the region. In the “Classico” portion, White shares such iconic dishes as Meatballs Braised in Tomato Sauce; Pasta and Bean Soup; Cavatelli with Lamb Ragù and Bell Peppers; and Roasted Pork Leg with Rosemary and Black Pepper. The “Moderno” chapters feature recipes that have put White’s restaurants on the map, including Chicken Liver Crostini with Marsala-Braised Onions; Fusili with Red Wine–Braised Octopus and Bone Marrow; and Veal Chops with Roasted Endive and Pancetta Cream Sauce. Both the Classico and Moderno sections offer ideas for your whole meal: first courses (Vitello Tonnato, Garganelli with Caviar Cream ), soups (Zuppa di Baccalá, White Bean Soup with Sautéed Shrimp), pastas (Tortellini alla Panna, Ricotta and Swiss Chard Tortelli), main courses (Pollo alla Diavola, Braised Lamb Shanks with Farrotto), and desserts (Crostata di Ricotta, Panna Cotta with Meyer Lemon–Basil Sorbet and Almond Milk Froth), as well as salads, pizzas, and basic formulas for pesto, stocks, and vinaigrettes. Including personal notes and anecdotes about White’s early sojourn in Italy and his flavorful career, Classico e Moderno will give you all the tools, tips, and tricks you need to cook tantalizing Italian dishes with the confidence of a seasoned chef. Praise for Michael White and Classico e Moderno “A masterpiece of culinary acumen and perfection in presentation . . . White once again sublimely deals with his cuisine of choice—Italian. In an attempt to bridge the gap between classic and modern, this chef extraordinaire offers the reader an experience in beauty and taste. . . . This book is a testament to both the importance/influence of Italian cuisine and to the rich and varied experiences its ingredients and tradition still have to offer.”—Publishers Weekly (starred review) “Exceedingly appealing . . . [Michael White] is one of the great chefs of modern Italian food in this country, and in Classico e Moderno he teaches us enough so that we can try to follow in his footsteps.”—Vogue “Hugely ambitious . . . White is one of a number of rising chefs here who aren’t Italian but have felt the freedom to refresh the concept of Italian food.”—Associated Press “The future of Italian gastronomy, thanks to the spectacular inventiveness he brings to modernizing the world’s most popular cuisine.”—Gotham “I’ve watched and tasted as Michael White has matured into his current position as one of the preeminent stewards and pioneers of Italian culinary tradition in America. Even his signature modern dishes are as relatable as the classics—and are perhaps even destined to be deemed classics in their own right some day.”—Thomas Keller, from the Foreword “Michael White has, in very short order, grabbed the Italian food crown for New York City.”—Anthony Bourdain",0345545532,9780345545534,450,Cooking,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kU9wAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=kU9wAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Cookbooks&hl=&cd=253&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kU9wAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Danish Cookbooks,Carol Gold,N/A,2007,"Cookbooks tell stories. They open up the worlds in which the people who wrote and read them once lived. In the hands of a good historian, cookbooks can be shown to contain the markings of political, social, and ideological changes that we conventionally locate outside the kitchen. Over time, cookbooks allow us to trace the course of empires, of social roles, and of new nations. Danish Cookbooks draws from three hundred years of cookbooks to trace the growth of a bourgeois consciousness, the development of domesticity and gendered spheres, and the evolution of nationalism and a specific Danish identity from the early seventeenth to the end of the nineteenth century. Like all prescriptive literature, cookbooks do not merely reflect the changes of the day but also constitute them. Historian Carol Gold reads recipes and cooking instructions for what can they tell us about literacy levels, division of labor in the kitchen and in society, and changes in the gendered aspects of publishing and utilizing cookbooks. Gold explores the authors' instructions for economic and hygienic housekeeping, and their sentiments about Danish identity as spelled out in dishes and spices. Just as the Danish nation would manage the body politic, so women were exhorted to manage the house and ensure the family's physical and moral health. Through the pages of cookbooks-recipes, menus, and table settings-we can chart the growth of a nationalist Denmark and track the development of what it means to be a Dane.",N/A,N/A,238,Cooking,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t4q1AAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=t4q1AAAAIAAJ&q=Cookbooks&dq=Cookbooks&hl=&cd=268&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=t4q1AAAAIAAJ&dq=Cookbooks&hl=&source=gbs_api

The Del Posto Cookbook,Mark Ladner,Grand Central Life & Style,2016-11-01,"The definitive cookbook on refined Italian Cuisine by the celebrated chef at Mario Batali's and Lidia Bastianich's award-winning destination restaurant in New York City. Mark Ladner, the Chef at Del Posto, redefines what excellent Italian Cooking in America can be. With a focus on regional Italian ingredients and tradition, Ladner has chosen recipes that bring together flavors from the old country, but in sophisticated new ways, like: Fried Calamari with Spicy Caper Butter Sauce; Red Wine Risotto with Carrot Puree, Monkfish Piccata, Veal Braciole, and Ricotta-Chocolate Tortino But what is special is that these recipes will really work in the home kitchen, unlike some ambitious cookbooks like this. And given Del Posto's origin and founders, the book includes recipes by Lidia Bastianich, and forewords by Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich.Plus, the award-winning sommelier at Del Posto offers advice on which Italian varietals to serve with what dishes. All this is complemented by photography that is inspired by 16th century still life paintings.

The Soup and Bread Cookbook,Beatrice Ojakangas,U of Minnesota Press,2020-11-03,"More than one hundred delectable and satisfying soup and bread pairings from beloved James Beard Cookbook Hall of Famer Beatrice Ojakangas When eating out, Beatrice Ojakangas’s mother told her, you could never go wrong ordering soup. And then, of course, there should be bread to go with it. Beatrice has been sampling soup ever since, and in The Soup and Bread Cookbook the James Beard Cookbook Hall of Famer takes us along on her “soup travels,” giving us delicious tastes from throughout the world and teaching us how to make them at home. International yet rooted in the rhythm of the Minnesota seasons—ranging from the cool, refreshing soups of summer to hearty winter fare—these soups, stews, and chowders take their inspiration from farmers’ markets and local organic grocery stores: real ingredients, always, and irresistible flavors. Whether it’s a basic broth or stock or a long-simmering vegetable-filled stew, there is a bread to go along—enough to fill a cookbook on their own, in fact. Here we have new potato spring pea soup together with chive-dill batter bread, or spicy mango melon soup with lemon poppy seed muffins, or super-simple salmon chowder with sour rye buns, or good old chicken and dumpling soup with Dutch raisin bread—or perhaps your craving is satisfied with Asian lemon-ginger soup with sesame sunflower breadsticks, or Avgolemono soup with pita bread, or Polish Easter soup with sourdough rye, or Brie and apple soup with fougasse. Whatever your palate desires, The Soup and Bread Cookbook will, as The Splendid Table suggests, “banish the Campbell’s from your cupboard forever.” Pull up a chair. Open the book.

For first-time restaurateurs Demetri Makoulis and Sarah Schneider and chef/partner Nick Korbee, eggs aren’t just an easy, protein-packed breakfast go-to, but an extraordinary complement to New York’s wealth of local produce and artisanal meats, grains, and cheeses. With Egg Shop anyone can create their delicious Egg Shop experience at home—whether it’s a quiet breakfast for one or a boozy brunch for twenty. Inside you’ll find proper egg-cooking techniques as well as instructions on incorporating eggs into super-delicious dishes from the health-conscious to the decadent, using fresh, delicious ingredients: homemade seeded rye bread, the best-quality bacon, and the perfect melting cheese. After mastering the most common and useful egg cooking methods (scrambled, poached, fried) Nick Korbee teaches you how to unlock egg superpowers—coddling them in Mason jars full of truffle oil and basting them with coffee-infused compound chocolate-bacon butter.

My New Mediterranean Cookbook,Jeannette Seaver,Simon and Schuster,2013-02-22,"Sumptuous new cookbook of recipes focused on nutritionally proven ingredients that are as tasty as they are healthy. Here is the cookbook that will satisfy the most demanding of palates, bring fun into the kitchen and add pleasure and possibly years to your life. The world has long known that the people of the Mediterranean generally live longer and healthier than the rest of the Western world, a fact often ascribed to their eating habits. In her new book, Jeanette Seaver, a gourmet chef who was born and raised in France, offers almost 200 mouth-watering recipes using delicious traditional Mediterranean-diet ingredients: fresh fruits and vegetables, legumes, nuts, cereals, olive oil, and fish, with judicious amounts of red meat and poultry. With over 50 first courses, including 15 original soups, 65 main courses—seafood, meat, and meatless—a wide selection of delectable vegetables and salads, and some 50 fabulous deserts, this richly varied volume is bound to please the novice as well as the most meticulous home chef. Try such dishes as: Smoked eggplant caviar Gratin of cod and spinach Broiled marinated duck breast with grilled peaches Stuffed zucchini flowers with red-pepper coulis Moussaka of artichokes and veal Lemon macaroon torte Italian pear tart With ingredients pulled from all corners of the Mediterranean, the recipes may first appear exotic, but they are fast and easy to prepare.

Eva's Kitchen,"Eva Longoria, Marah Stets",Clarkson Potter,2011-04-05,"Eva Longoria may be most recognized for her role as Desperate Housewives’ saucy Gabrielle Solis, but on her own time, there are few places she would rather be than in the kitchen, cooking the food she loves for her family and friends. The recipes in Eva’s Kitchen trace her life story, taking readers on her culinary journey—from the food she was brought up on to the recipes inspired by her travels abroad to the dishes she serves during casual nights at home. Eva believes that good cooking relies on local, fresh, easy-to-find ingredients. Offering 100 of her favorite dishes—many of which are family recipes collected over the years—all fused with her passion for cooking, Eva teaches readers essential cooking skills and she sprinkles in the histories and traditions behind her favorite dishes, including personal stories and anecdotes that capture the warmth, humor, and joy of her most memorable meals. Inspired by her heritage, Eva highlights the essentials of great Mexican cooking, Texas style—with her family’s recipes and techniques for making the world’s best tamales, homemade tortillas, Spanish rice, and Pan de Polvo (Mexican pastry), to name a few. She also offers dishes from a variety of international cuisines, from Latin American to Italian and French, inspired by her globe-trotting travels. A taste of Lemon Dover Sole whisks Eva to a tiny hotel-restaurant she once visited on a trip to Normandy; the recipe for Cannellini Beans with Crushed Red Pepper was a souvenir from a trip to Florence; kimchi adds a kick to her Spicy Roasted Brussels Sprouts, a Thanksgiving staple; and Yellow Squash Soup with Lemon brings her full circle, back to her family’s vegetable garden in Corpus Christi. With full-color food photographs, intimate portraits of her family and friends, and a glimpse into Eva’s home and her lesser-known domestic side (family first, acting second, she says), Eva’s debut cookbook will entice her loyal fans and inspire home cooks to broaden their culinary horizons and create memorable meals for the people they love.",0307952258,9780307952257,226,Cooking,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Qkc_zrgJyl8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,5,1,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=Qkc_zrgJyl8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Cookbooks&hl=&cd=317&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Qkc_zrgJyl8C&source=gbs_api

Even after living in Tokyo for decades and running two ramen shops that earned him international renown, he remained a gaijin. Fortunately, being a lifelong outsider has made Orkin a more curious, open, and studious chef. In The Gaijin Cookbook, he condenses his experiences into approachable recipes for every occasion, including weeknights with picky kids, boozy weekends, and celebrations. Everyday dishes like Pork and Miso-Ginger Stew, Stir-Fried Udon, and Japanese Spaghetti with Tomato Sauce are what keep the Orkin family connected to Japan. For more festive dinners, he suggests a Temaki Party, where guests assemble their own sushi from cooked and fresh fillings.

Beyond a cookbook, Kitchen Creativity is a paradigm-shifting guide to inventive cooking (without recipes!) that will inspire you to think, improvise, and cook like the world's best chefs. Great cooking is as much about intuition and imagination as it is about flavor and technique. Kitchen Creativity distills brilliant insights into these creative processes from more than 100 top restaurant kitchens, including the Bazaar, Blue Hill, Daniel, Dirt Candy, Eleven Madison Park and the NoMad, Gramercy Tavern, the Inn at Little Washington, Le Bernardin, Oleana, Rustic Canyon, Saison, Single Thread, and Topolobampo. Based on four years of extensive research and dozens of in-depth interviews, Kitchen Creativity illuminates the method (and occasional madness) of culinary invention. Part I reveals how to learn foundational skills, including how to appreciate, taste, and season classic dishes (Stage 1: Mastery), before reinventing the classics from a new perspective (Stage 2: Alchemy). Einstein's secret of genius-combinatory play-pushes chefs to develop unique creations and heighten their outer and inner senses (Stage 3: Creativity). Part II's A-to-Z entries are an invaluable culinary idea generator, with exercises to prompt new imaginings. You'll also discover: experts' criteria for creating new dishes, desserts, and drinks; comprehensive seasonality charts to spark inspiration all year long; how to season food like a pro, and how to create complex yet balanced layers of flavor; the amazing true stories of historic dishes, like how desperate maitre d' ""Nacho"" Anaya invented nachos; and proven tips to jump-start your creative process.

Through deeply personal recipes and stories about the neighborhood that often inspires them, this groundbreaking cookbook is an intimate account of how Chinese food became American food and the making of a Chinese American chef. Jew takes inspiration from classic Chinatown recipes to create innovative spins like Sizzling Rice Soup, Squid Ink Wontons, Orange Chicken Wings, Liberty Roast Duck, Mushroom Mu Shu, and Banana Black Sesame Pie. From the fundamentals of Chinese cooking to master class recipes, he interweaves recipes and techniques with stories about their origins in Chinatown and in his own family history. And he connects his classical training and American roots to Chinese traditions in chapters celebrating dim sum, dumplings, and banquet-style parties.

The Real Paleo Diet Cookbook,Loren Cordain,Houghton Mifflin Harcourt,2015-03-03,"“This book is beautifully illustrated, and the recipes are nothing short of delicious and fun to prepare. This is really the gourmet Paleo Diet.”—Jack Challem, bestselling author of The Inflammation Syndrome It’s official—the real Paleo Diet is back. Loved for its simplicity, health benefits, and because it really works, the diet has been widely imitated since its release. Yet no one knows this plan better than Loren Cordain, its creator. As an expert in evolutionary medicine, Cordain realized we had moved away from the foods we were designed to eat—lean proteins, fruits, and vegetables—while modern staples such as sugar, salt, and carbohydrates were creating a host of 21st-century health issues, including obesity and heart disease. By eating the right food, people are healthier. But can eating Paleo be tasty? In this all-new cookbook with 250 recipes and 75 photos, Cordain makes eating Paleo a pleasure, not a burden. Ranging from Cucumber Aqua Fresca to Fruit-Stuffed Top Loin Roast with Brandy Sauce, the recipes satisfy even the most finicky. This is the book the Paleo community has been waiting for—scientific accuracy combined with great taste. “The cookbook for the Paleo gourmet! These recipes are delicious, healthy, and visually stunning, with innovative flavor combinations and use of spices. More importantly, this book presents clearly and concisely which foods belong on the Paleo diet and which do not, along with why. Even experienced Paleo chefs will find that these recipes expand and enliven the Paleo palate.”—Lynda Frassetto, MD",054430327X,9780544303270,357,Cooking,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RQd-BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=RQd-BAAAQBAJ&dq=Cookbooks&hl=&cd=367&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=RQd-BAAAQBAJ&dq=Cookbooks&hl=&source=gbs_api

Sook's Cookbook,Marie Rudisill,LSU Press,2008-09-15,"Sook's Cookbook brims with delicious, uniquely southern recipes such as green olive jambalaya, watermelon rind preserves, and poinsettia cake, as well as classic buttermilk biscuits and lemon meringue pie. Marie Rudisill first began working on Sook's Cookbook with her nephew, Truman Capote, in the late 1940s to pay tribute to her charming, eccentric aunt, Sook Faulk. After putting the project aside for many years, Rudisill developed the book's methodology on her own: using nineteenth-century plantation daybooks for inspiration, she paired recipes with profiles of family and community cooks.In these pages, you'll meet Sook -- made famous in Capote's story, ""A Christmas Memory"" -- with her kitchen windowsill herb garden (complete with two pet chameleons to ward off bugs) and her penchant for cooking on her big, black woodstove year-round -- even on the hottest summer days. Recipes for tea sugar cookies and lemon-and-parsley butter tea sandwiches follow the profile of Marie's aunt Jenny, who ran the Faulk household, as well as her own renowned hat and accessory shop. Rudisill also spotlights often-overlooked cooks -- Little Bit, the official house cook, and Corrie Wolff, a housekeeper and occasional cook, whose recipes feature the Cajun and Creole flavors of Louisiana, as well as Sem, who prepared special food for parties, weddings, and funerals. In his foreword, Gourmet contributing editor John T. Edge calls Sook's Cookbook -- first published in 1989 -- ""one of the most compelling regional cookbooks of the latter half of the twentieth century."" He also celebrates Marie Rudisill's character and spirit -- from her sassy appearances on the Tonight Show, where she became known as the Fruitcake Lady, to her deep appreciation of the people and the old southern ways she knew and loved in Monroeville, Alabama. Much more than a cookbook, these pages pay homage to a small town in the Deep South and the intriguing people who made it come alive.",0807133795,9780807133798,194,Cooking,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oUQS8BTvmUUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,5,1,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=oUQS8BTvmUUC&dq=Cookbooks&hl=&cd=387&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=oUQS8BTvmUUC&dq=Cookbooks&hl=&source=gbs_api

The Big Sur Bakery Cookbook,"Michelle Wojtowicz, Philip Wojtowicz, Michael Gibson, Catherine Price",Harper Collins,2009-06-30,"Here from the celebrated California restaurant Big Sur Bakery is a stunningly photographed cookbook showcasing seasonal ingredients, local vintners, fishermen, and farmers—and the food that makes the Big Sur Bakery unique. Tucked behind a gas station off California's legendary Highway 1, the Big Sur Bakery is easy to miss. But don't be fooled by its unassuming location—stumbling across the Bakery, as countless visitors have done on their way up and down the Pacific Coast, will make you feel as if you've discovered a secret: a gem of a restaurant where the food, people, and atmosphere meld together in a perfect embodiment of the spirit of Big Sur. The three restaurant owners, chef Philip Wojtowicz, baker Michelle Wojtowicz, and host Michael Gilson, escaped the Los Angeles food scene to create their version of the ideal restaurant, nestled in the heart of some of the most beautiful country in the world. This is simple, wood-fired American cooking at its best, executed in a way that lets the ingredients—seasonal and often locally produced—shine. Weekend brunches feature thick, nine-grain pancakes and savory breakfast pizza topped with crisp bacon, fresh herbs, and pasture-raised eggs. At night, Phil offers classics like Grilled Prime Rib Steak with Red Wine Sauce along with twists on traditional favorites like Venison Osso Buco or Rockfish Scampi. And every meal should end with one of Michelle's great desserts, whether it's a homemade Peppermint Ice Cream Sundae or Hazelnut Flan with Roasted Cherries. But this is more than a cookbook; it's a yearlong glimpse into what it's really like to live in Big Sur, introducing the people and places that make the restaurant's renowned food possible, including Wayne Hyland, hunter and forager, Jamie Collins, organic row cropper, and Gary Pisoni, the eccentric vintner who supplies some of the restaurant's most beloved wine. With its outstanding photography, lively profiles, and dozens of must-make recipes, this book helps bring the experience of Big Sur home.",0061933015,9780061933011,278,Cooking,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VttvrPyt-EAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=VttvrPyt-EAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Cookbooks&hl=&cd=397&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=VttvrPyt-EAC&dq=Cookbooks&hl=&source=gbs_api

The Reluctant Vegetarian Cookbook,Sharalyn Pliler,AuthorHouse,2009-07-08,"“Who in their right minds would ever want to be a vegetarian?” Sharalyn Pliler asked just months before she—accidentally—became one. A few days into a camping trip in the woods, she was amazed to experience that instead of getting weaker without meat, just the opposite happened—she felt more energetic, lighter and more clear-headed, needing to eat less than before while enjoying food even more, as if her taste buds had come alive. Reluctant to become a vegetarian but unable to argue with definitive direct experience, she had no choice but to begin the transition from familiar meat cookery to the unknown world of vegetarianism. Not many cookbooks are page-turners but with her light-hearted style, down-home sense of humor and master’s level writing skills, readers are carried effortlessly as she tells her story of awakening to the pleasures and techniques of vegetarianism.

Momofuku Milk Bar,Christina Tosi,Clarkson Potter,2011-10-25,"The highly anticipated complement to the New York Times bestselling Momofuku cookbook, Momofuku Milk Bar reveals the recipes for the innovative, addictive cookies, pies, cakes, ice creams, and more from the wildly popular Milk Bar bakery. Momofuku Milk Bar shares the recipes for Christina Tosi’s fantastic desserts—the now-legendary riffs on childhood flavors and down-home classics (all essentially derived from ten mother recipes)—along with the compelling narrative of the unlikely beginnings of this quirky bakery’s success. It all started one day when Momofuku founder David Chang asked Christina to make a dessert for dinner that night. Just like that, the pastry program at Momofuku began. Christina’s playful desserts, including the compost cookie, a chunky chocolate-chip cookie studded with crunchy salty pretzels and coffee grounds; the crack pie, a sugary-buttery confection as craveable as the name implies; the cereal milk ice cream, made from everyone’s favorite part of a nutritious breakfast—the milk at the bottom of a bowl of cereal; and the easy layer cakes that forgo fancy frosting in favor of unfinished edges that hint at the yumminess inside helped the restaurants earn praise from the New York Times and the Michelin Guide and led to the opening of Milk Bar, which now draws fans from around the country and the world. With all the recipes for the bakery’s most beloved desserts—along with ones for savory baked goods that take a page from Chang’s Asian-flavored cuisine, such as Kimchi Croissants with Blue Cheese—and 100 color photographs, Momofuku Milk Bar makes baking irresistible off-beat treats at home both foolproof and fun.",0307720497,9780307720498,258,Cooking,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WSkeAYAqKYoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=WSkeAYAqKYoC&dq=Cookbooks&hl=&cd=417&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=WSkeAYAqKYoC&dq=Cookbooks&hl=&source=gbs_api

Vegetronic,Alexis Gauthier,Clarkson Potter,2013-10-22,"What is “vegetronic”? A world where vegetables (and fruits, too) are at the center of delicious meals—where crisp broccoli is the star of a dinner party and where the flavors and textures of bright, just-picked ingredients are a source of inspiration. As much for carnivores as it is for vegetarians, Vegetronic is a playful and provocative examination of the potential of fresh produce. In this debut cookbook, Michelin-starred chef Alexis Gauthier introduces favorite ingredients from his kitchen—from fragrant rose petals to artichokes, from ripe tomatoes to overripe strawberries—and explains how to highlight their flavors in visually arresting, vegetable-intensive (but not always vegetarian) preparations. As arresting in their presentation as they are boldly flavored, these dishes can be as simple as peeling an orange or dicing a cucumber. Gauthier offers suggestions for coaxing something delicious from early- or late-in-season ingredients, like unyieldingly hard peaches or end-of-season fava beans and peas. Gauthier shows you how to harness eggplant’s velvety texture for a sweet-and-sour bruschetta, or how to make a pan-fried head of broccoli dressed with whole-grain mustard into a worthy main course. Even when a dish gets an extra bump from bacon, chicken broth, or lamb jus, Gauthier’s emphasis is always on the essential flavor of the vegetable or fruit that centers the dish as a whole. These 120 diverse recipes focus on the potential of fresh fruits and vegetables—a salad of warm asparagus ribbons set over ricotta gnocchi and crunchy bacon; a scattering of crisp apples over shockingly pink beets; a chilled fava bean soup topped with a silky poached egg; a pumpkin risotto made even creamier with a dash of mascarpone. So whether you’re a committed vegetarian or just an enthusiastic omnivore, Vegetronic will make you rethink the way you shop, cook, and eat all year long.",0770435033,9780770435035,813,Cooking,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3ELw0nHfKx0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=3ELw0nHfKx0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Cookbooks&hl=&cd=433&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3ELw0nHfKx0C&source=gbs_api

The Herbfarm Cookbook,Jerry Traunfeld,Simon and Schuster,2013-10-16,"Not so long ago, parsley was the only fresh herb available to most American cooks. Today, bunches of fresh oregano and rosemary can be found in nearly every supermarket, basil and mint grow abundantly in backyards from coast to coast, and garden centers offer pots of edible geraniums and lemon thyme. But once these herbs reach the kitchen, the inevitable question arises: Now what do I do with them? Here, at last, is the first truly comprehensive cookbook to cover all aspects of growing, handling, and cooking with fresh herbs. Jerry Traunfeld grew up cooking and gardening in Maryland, but it wasn't until the 1980s, after he had graduated from the California Culinary Academy and was working at Jeremiah Tower's Stars restaurant in San Francisco, that he began testing the amazing potential of herb cuisine. For the past decade, Jerry Traunfeld has been chef at The Herbfarm, an enchanted restaurant surrounded by kitchen gardens and tucked into the rainy foothills of the Cascade Mountains, east of Seattle. His brilliant nine-course herb-inspired menus have made reservations at the Herbfarm among the most coveted in the country.

""The table is a meeting place, a gathering ground, the source of sustenance and nourishment, festivity, safety, and satisfaction. A person cooking is a person giving: Even the simplest food is a gift."" Laurie Colwin Cooking with new ingredients and working with measures is also an enjoyable way to improve children's vocabulary and show how math is used in real life and not just in a text book.

Recipes are grouped into 15 sections. Each section is headed by a chart that lists the recipes in the section and the kind of diet for which it is appropriate. Many recipes are devoid of as many as 4 allergens (wheat, corn, eggs, milk). Some recipes have instructions for adding milk and eggs if they are allowed; these are indicated in the tabular material at the top of the section.
