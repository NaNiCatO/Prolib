Experimental Methods in Organic Fluorine Chemistry,"Tomoya Kitazume, Takashi Yamazaki",CRC Press,1999-03-08,"In the fields of biologically active materials and functional materials, fluorinated organic materials are becoming a focus of significant interest. Over the past decade synthetic methodologies and reagents in fluorine chemistry have been developed, especially stereocontrolled synthetic methods, enzymatic resolution to synthesize enantiomers, fluoromethylated reagents, and fluorination reagents. These methods have contributed to the opening of new pathways for fluorinated materials. However, few fluorinated materials have been put to commercial use. Furthermore, there remain problems to be solved, such as the handling of the materials, availability of reagents and selectivity (stereo-, regio-, and/or chemoselectivity). Research chemists, technical engineers, and graduate students in all branches of chemistry, pharmaceutics, and material science interested in fluorinated materials need to know detailed experimental procedures of how to synthesize the target fluorinated materials. This volume summarizes the chemical and microbial methods for obtaining functionalized fluorinated materials for use as building blocks; detailed experimental methods (reaction conditions, solvent, temperature, handling techniques, etc.); and the stereoview (possible absolute configuration) of the structures with spectral data. Mono-, di-, tri-, and polyfluorinated materials derived from fluorinating agents, fluoromethylated reagents and building blocks are summarized. A chemical name index, molecular formula index, and reagent index are also included. The publication of this monograph will provide access to the enormous possibilities in fluorine chemistry, biological material chemistry, and functionalized material chemistry.",9056991221,9789056991227,278,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9w8KF5SnfPsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=9w8KF5SnfPsC&pg=PA21&dq=Chemistry&hl=&cd=43&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=9w8KF5SnfPsC&dq=Chemistry&hl=&source=gbs_api

The Chemistry of Nitrogen-rich Functional Groups,"Alexander Greer, Joel F. Liebman",John Wiley & Sons,2019-12-31,"Nitrogen is unique among the non-carbon atoms in its ability to form single, double, and triple bonds with itself, giving rise to a wide range of organic-chemical groups containing several nitrogen atoms in different states and geometries. The present volume surveys the properties and chemical behaviour of all important nitrogen-rich organic-chemical groups, including azides, azimines, aziridines, diazo compounds, nitramines, nitrenes, nitrosamines, polyazine N-oxides, tetrazoles, triazanes, triazenes, and triazoles. A special focus lies on commercially important species which are used, e. g., as powerful explosives.

The Role of Ecological Chemistry in Pollution Research and Sustainable Development,"Ali Mufit Bahadir, Gheorghe Duca",Springer Science & Business Media,2009-08-10,"Sustainable Development has become the leading concept of the 21 century. It describes a development, which agrees with the needs of the present generation but does not endanger the chances of the coming generations to satisfy also their needs. “Sustainable development” has become an important general goal for all fields of life like economy, ecology and social balance. The development and shaping of our future has been discussed internationally like on the summits of the Conferences in Rio and in Johannesburg. But this is also a topic on national base in various countries. Leading authorities in various fields of economy and politics have also accepted this concept. Although the concept of sustainable development has been generally accepted, there are still problems how to achieve and evaluate these general goals. It is clear that the definitions about the prime needs vary from man to man, from country to country and from continent to continent. But pollution does not respect national borders. Therefore, it is necessary to develop the politics of economy, ecology and social demands by a synergistic way that they are strengthened by each other. If it is not possible to stop tendencies, which threaten the future quality of life, the cost demands of societies will dramatically increase and negative tendencies will become irreversible.",904812901X,9789048129010,313,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5s4qPwkHGw8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=5s4qPwkHGw8C&pg=PR6&dq=Chemistry&hl=&cd=59&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=5s4qPwkHGw8C&dq=Chemistry&hl=&source=gbs_api

Chemistry and Microstructure of Solidified Waste Forms,Roger D. Spence,CRC Press,1992-12-15,"Chemistry and Microstructure of Solidified Waste Forms presents a comprehensive summary of mechanisms of immobilization in cementitious waste forms and the effect of waste species on cement chemistry and morphology. The book introduces the well-known chemistry and microstructure of cement pastes, in addition to common mechanisms of immobilization of waste species in cementitious waste forms. The fundamental chemical and microstructural fate of waste species is reviewed, and a technique for studying cementitious waste forms using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) is described with examples of its application. Chemistry and Microstructure of Solidified Waste Forms also presents evidence to prove that chromium in waste becomes part of the cement matrix, and the potentially harmful effect of this process is discussed. Data for interpretations are included so that other researchers can analyze the data and draw their own conclusions. The book also discusses how solubility and solubility theory can be combined with leach theory and diffusion theory to predict the leaching performance of cementitious waste forms. Chemistry and Microstructure of Solidified Waste Forms will prove invaluable to hazardous waste professionals, engineers, environmental engineers, chemical engineers, waste disposal managers, waste form developers and researchers, and regulators.",0873717481,9780873717489,290,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3vfhEid0cT4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=3vfhEid0cT4C&pg=PP11&dq=Chemistry&hl=&cd=66&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=3vfhEid0cT4C&dq=Chemistry&hl=&source=gbs_api

Introduction to Chemistry,Amos Turk,Elsevier,2013-07-15,"Introduction to Chemistry is a 26-chapter introductory textbook in general chemistry. This book deals first with the atoms and the arithmetic and energetics of their combination into molecules. The subsequent chapters consider the nature of the interactions among atoms or the so-called chemical bonding. This topic is followed by discussions on the nature of intermolecular forces and the states of matter. This text further explores the statistics and dynamics of chemistry, including the study of equilibrium and kinetics. Other chapters cover the aspects of ionic equilibrium, acids and bases, and galvanic cells. The concluding chapters focus on a descriptive study of chemistry, such as the representative and transition elements, organic and nuclear chemistry, metals, polymers, and biochemistry. Teachers and undergraduate chemistry students will find this book of great value.",0323145051,9780323145053,592,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=M4DnBLzewOIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=M4DnBLzewOIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Chemistry&hl=&cd=110&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=M4DnBLzewOIC&source=gbs_api

Teaching Chemistry – A Studybook,"Ingo Eilks, Avi Hofstein",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-04-20,"This book focuses on developing and updating prospective and practicing chemistry teachers’ pedagogical content knowledge. The 11 chapters of the book discuss the most essential theories from general and science education, and in the second part of each of the chapters apply the theory to examples from the chemistry classroom. Key sentences, tasks for self-assessment, and suggestions for further reading are also included. The book is focused on many different issues a teacher of chemistry is concerned with. The chapters provide contemporary discussions of the chemistry curriculum, objectives and assessment, motivation, learning difficulties, linguistic issues, practical work, student active pedagogies, ICT, informal learning, continuous professional development, and teaching chemistry in developing environments. This book, with contributions from many of the world’s top experts in chemistry education, is a major publication offering something that has not previously been available. Within this single volume, chemistry teachers, teacher educators, and prospective teachers will find information and advice relating to key issues in teaching (such as the curriculum, assessment and so forth), but contextualised in terms of the specifics of teaching and learning of chemistry, and drawing upon the extensive research in the field. Moreover, the book is written in a scholarly style with extensive citations to the literature, thus providing an excellent starting point for teachers and research students undertaking scholarly studies in chemistry education; whilst, at the same time, offering insight and practical advice to support the planning of effective chemistry teaching. This book should be considered essential reading for those preparing for chemistry teaching, and will be an important addition to the libraries of all concerned with chemical education. Dr Keith S. Taber (University of Cambridge; Editor: Chemistry Education Research and Practice) The highly regarded collection of authors in this book fills a critical void by providing an essential resource for teachers of chemistry to enhance pedagogical content knowledge for teaching modern chemistry. Through clever orchestration of examples and theory, and with carefully framed guiding questions, the book equips teachers to act on the relevance of essential chemistry knowledge to navigate such challenges as context, motivation to learn, thinking, activity, language, assessment, and maintaining professional expertise. If you are a secondary or post-secondary teacher of chemistry, this book will quickly become a favorite well-thumbed resource!

Food,Tom P Coultate,Royal Society of Chemistry,2023-10-11,"Since 1984 this book, now in its 7th edition and thoroughly updated, has introduced the crucial interface between our diet and the essentially chemical nature of what we eat and drink. The contributions of the various classes of natural food components, as well as additives and contaminants, to the nutritional value of foods are considered. These include the nutrients required in large amounts like carbohydrates, proteins, fat, minerals and water as well as the less bulky nutrients such as vitamins, flavours, colours and preservatives. Undesirable food components, including allergens, pesticide residues and toxins are also dealt with. Not just the nature of food components are described, but also how they behave in storage, processing and cooking and accompanying changes in a food’s nutritional value. The book features a ‘Special Topics’ section at the end of each chapter for specialist readers and advanced students, comprehensive listings of up-to-date review articles and recommended books for further reading, an exhaustive index and the structural formulae of over 500 food components. Frequent reference is also made to wider food and health issues, e.g. lactose intolerance, polyunsaturated fatty acids, wheat and gluten evolution, salt and hypertension, flavonoids in tea and fruit, and the increasing replacement of artificial with natural food colours. Food: The Chemistry of its Components will be of particular interest to students and teachers of food science, nutrition and applied chemistry in universities, colleges and schools.

Introduction to Chemistry and The Environment,Baldwin King,Wipf and Stock Publishers,2002-03-06,"Introduction to Chemistry and the Environment is written primarily to satisfy the need for a suitable textbook for a one-semester course in chemistry and the environment for non-science majors. It is also suitable for persons who have no knowledge of chemistry but would like to be informed about the science behind many of the environmental issues facing the general public. The pedagogical approach is first to provide the basics of chemistry in a conceptual, non-mathematical way, using material from the environment where possible. Then these principles are used to discuss many of the major issues in air and water pollution. The text consists of ten brief chapters. The first five chapters discuss chemical principles in a succinct but scientifically sound manner. The individual instructor is encouraged to elaborate on these topics as he or she sees fit. The next two chapters discuss the properties of gases, especially the components of air, and then issues in air pollution. The next two chapters focus on the properties of water and aqueous solutions followed by issues in water pollution. The final brief chapter is an attempt to put everything in perspective by discussing human health and the environment. Included at the end of each chapter are some suggested readings for those who would like a more detailed discussion of the topics covered. A set of discussion-type questions ends each chapter. Writing science for nonscientists is a difficult task. However, Baldwin King has used his many years as a chemical educator to produce a text which is clear and eminently readable by non-chemists.",1579109055,9781579109059,175,Religion,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-L9KAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=-L9KAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Chemistry&hl=&cd=187&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-L9KAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Anion Receptor Chemistry,"Jonathan L. Sessler, Philip A. Gale, Won-Seob Cho",Royal Society of Chemistry,2006,"Anion recognition plays a critical role in a range of biological processes, and a variety of receptors and carriers can be found throughout the natural world. Chemists working in the area of supramolecular chemistry have created a range of anion receptors, drawing inspiration from nature as well as their own inventive processes. This book traces the origins of anion recognition chemistry as a unique sub-field in supramolecular chemistry while illustrating the basic approaches currently being used to effect receptor design. The combination of biological overview and summary of current synthetic approaches provides a coverage that is both comprehensive and comprehensible. First, the authors detail the key design motifs that have been used to generate synthetic receptors and which are likely to provide the basis for further developments. They also highlight briefly some of the features that are present in naturally occurring anion recognition and transport systems and summarise the applications of anion recognition chemistry. Providing as it does a detailed review for practitioners in the field and a concise introduction to the topic for newcomers, Anion Receptor Chemistry reflects the current state of the art.

Physical Inorganic Chemistry,S. F. A. Kettle,Springer,2013-11-11,"GEORGE CHRISTOU Indiana University, Bloomington I am no doubt representative of a large number of current inorganic chemists in having obtained my undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in the 1970s. It was during this period that I began my continuing love affair with this subject, and the fact that it happened while I was a student in an organic laboratory is beside the point. I was always enchanted by the more physical aspects of inorganic chemistry; while being captivated from an early stage by the synthetic side, and the measure of creation with a small c that it entails, I nevertheless found the application of various theoretical, spectroscopic and physicochemical techniques to inorganic compounds to be fascinating, stimulating, educational and downright exciting. The various bonding theories, for example, and their use to explain or interpret spectroscopic observations were more or less universally accepted as belonging within the realm of inorganic chemistry, and textbooks of the day had whole sections on bonding theories, magnetism, kinetics, electron-transfer mechanisms and so on. However, things changed, and subsequent inorganic chemistry teaching texts tended to emphasize the more synthetic and descriptive side of the field. There are a number of reasons for this, and they no doubt include the rise of diamagnetic organometallic chemistry as the dominant subdiscipline within inorganic chemistry and its relative narrowness vis-d-vis physical methods required for its prosecution.",3662251914,9783662251911,503,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=14nnCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=14nnCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Chemistry&hl=&cd=201&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=14nnCAAAQBAJ&dq=Chemistry&hl=&source=gbs_api

The Story of Alchemy and the Beginnings of Chemistry,M. M. Pattison Muir,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,2017-06-03,"CHAPTER I THE EXPLANATION OF MATERIAL CHANGES GIVEN BY THE GREEK THINKERS. For thousands of years before men had any accurate and exact knowledge of the changes of material things, they had thought about these changes, regarded them as revelations of spiritual truths, built on them theories of things in heaven and earth (and a good many things in neither), and used them in manufactures, arts, and handicrafts, especially in one very curious manufacture wherein not the thousandth fragment of a grain of the finished article was ever produced. The accurate and systematic study of the changes which material things undergo is called chemistry; we may, perhaps, describe alchemy as the superficial, and what may be called subjective, examination of these changes, and the speculative systems, and imaginary arts and manufactures, founded on that examination. We are assured by many old writers that Adam was the first alchemist, and we are told by one of the initiated that Adam was created on the sixth day, being the 15th of March, of the first year of the world; certainly alchemy had a long life, for chemistry did not begin until about the middle of the 18th century. No branch of science has had so long a period of incubation as chemistry. There must be some extraordinary difficulty in the way of disentangling the steps of those changes wherein substances of one kind are produced from substances totally unlike them. To inquire how those of acute intellects and much learning regarded such occurrences in the times when man's outlook on the world was very different from what it is now, ought to be interesting, and the results of that inquiry must surely be instructive. If the reader turns to a modern book on chemistry (for instance, The Story of the Chemical Elements, in this series), he will find, at first, superficial descriptions of special instances of those occurrences which are the subject of the chemist's study; he will learn that only certain parts of such events are dealt with in chemistry; more accurate descriptions will then be given of changes which occur in nature, or can be produced by altering the ordinary conditions, and the reader will be taught to see certain points of likeness between these changes; he will be shown how to disentangle chemical occurrences, to find their similarities and differences; and, gradually, he will feel his way to general statements, which are more or less rigorous and accurate expressions of what holds good in a large number of chemical processes; finally, he will discover that some generalisations have been made which are exact and completely accurate descriptions applicable to every case of chemical change. But if we turn to the writings of the alchemists, we are in a different world. There is nothing even remotely resembling what one finds in a modern book on chemistry. Here are a few quotations from alchemical writings: ""It is necessary to deprive matter of its qualities in order to draw out its soul.... Copper is like a man; it has a soul and a body ... the soul is the most subtile part ... that is to say, the tinctorial spirit. The body is the ponderable, material, terrestrial thing, endowed with a shadow.... After a series of suitable treatments copper becomes without shadow and better than gold.... The elements grow and are transmuted, because it is their qualities, not their substances which are contrary.""

An excellent reference for environmental chemists and scientific administrators of environmental programs, this book contains material reflecting the many recent changes in this rapidly developing discipline. The first three chapters discuss the most fundamental aspects of aluminum chemistry: its quantitation in soils and natural waters, including speciation measurements, and its stable chemical forms, both as a dissolved solute and in a solid phase. These chapters emphasize both critical assessments of and definitive recommendations for laboratory methodologies and measured thermodynamic properties relating to aluminum chemistry. The next four chapters in The Environmental Chemistry of Aluminum build on this foundation to provide details of the polymeric chemistry of aluminum: its polynuclear and colloidal hydrolytic species in aqueous solution, its complexes with natural organic ligands, including humic substances, and its role as an adsorptive and adsorbent in surface reactions. These chapters are grounded in experimental results rather than conceptual modeling. The final three chapters describe the chemistry of aluminum in soils, waters, and watersheds.

There are chapters that explain social media usage in academia, industry, grants, and professional organizations. Some chapters focus on a teaching model, others extend the focus to encompass personal and professional social media usage. Most chapters were contributed by current chemists who use social media, but some were contributed by those with a different perspective (e.g., social scientists, librarians, etc.). Nevertheless, all of the chapters provide a great deal of wisdom, which is built from the experience of using social media. These chapters also touch on emerging themes within social media communication: transformation and ethics issues including digital redlining, digital pedagogy, digital identity, curation, hypervisibility, and trolling. These themes form both a rich body of discussion and current research topics regarding online environments, including social media, and they have not yet achieved saturation in peer-reviewed literature.",0841232822,9780841232822,200,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3erotwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=3erotwEACAAJ&dq=Chemistry&hl=&cd=261&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=3erotwEACAAJ&dq=Chemistry&hl=&source=gbs_api

Chemistry and Chemists in Florence,"Marco Fontani, Mary Virginia Orna, Mariagrazia Costa",Springer,2016-04-15,"This brief offers a novel vision of the city of Florence, tracing the development of chemistry via the biographies of its most illustrious chemists. It documents not only important scientific research that came from the hands of Galileo Galilei and the physicists who followed in his footsteps, but also the growth of new disciplines such as chemistry, pharmaceutical chemistry, and biochemistry. It recounts how, in the Middle Ages, chemistry began as an applied science that served to bolster the Florentine economy, particularly in the textile dyeing industry. Later, important scientific collections founded by the ruling Medici family served as the basis of renowned museums that now house priceless artifacts and instruments. Also described in this text are the chemists such as Hugo Schiff, Angelo Angeli, and Luigi Rolla, who were active over the course of the following century and a quarter. The authors tell the story of the evolution of the Royal University of Florence, which ultimately became the University of Florence.

Intermetallic Chemistry,"Riccardo Ferro, Adriana Saccone",Elsevier,2011-08-26,"Intermetallic science is closely related to physics, chemistry, metallurgy, materials science & technology, and engineering. This book emphasizes the chemical aspects of this science, and therefore the mutual reactivity of metals and the characteristics of intermetallic compounds. Topics included are:• Phase diagrams of alloy systems. Many intermetallic systems form several compounds, generally not obeying common simple stoichiometric rules, which are often homogeneous in a certain range of compositions. The stability and extension of these phases are conveniently presented through phase diagrams.• Selected aspects of intermetallics structural chemistry, with emphasis on the solid state. The general structural characteristics of intermetallic phases are considered, with attention to nomenclature and to alternative and complementary methods of presenting crystal-chemical data. A brief account is given of derivative and degenerate structures, modular aspects of crystal structures, and of a few special groups of alloys such as quasicrystals and amorphous alloys. A number of selected structural prototypes with typical features, their possible grouping in structural ""families and their distribution among different types of alloys are provided.• Intermetallic reactivity trends in the Periodic Table. Attention is given to a few selected elemental parameters such as electron configuration and valence electron number and to their changes along the Table, which act as reference factors of the intermetallic behaviour. As an example, the relationships are considered between crystal structure and the number of valence electrons per atom (or per formula) in various classes of compounds or solid solution phases.• Alloying behaviour systematics of intermetallic systems with a description of the intermetallic reactivity of each element, or group of elements, in the order of their position in the Periodic Table. For each pair of metallic elements, their capability to form intermediate phases is summarised by maps and schemes. • A description of small scale preparation methods of intermetallics.

Organic Chemistry of Sulfur,S. Oae,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"In recent years organic sulfur chemistry has been growing at an even faster pace than the very rapid development in other fields of chemistry. This phenomenal growth is undoubtedly a reflection of industrial and public demands: not only was sulfur recently in overall surplus for the first time in the history of the chemical industry but it has now become a prin cipal environmental hazard in the form of sulfur dioxide, sulfuric acid and hydrogen sulfide. Another reason, discernible in the last fifteen years, has been the desire, on the part of individual chemists and all types of research managers, to move away from the established chemistry of carbon into the less well understood and sometimes virgin chemistries of the other elements which form covalent bonds. As a result of this movement the last decade has seen the development of sulfur chemistry into a well-organized and now much better understood branch of organic chemistry. Enough of the detail has become clear to see mechanistic interrelationships between previously unconnected reactions and with this clarification the whole subject has in tum become systema tized and subdivided. The divalent sulfur chemistry of thiols, monosulfides, disulfides and polysulfides is a large area in itself, much of it devoted to oxidation-reduction and the breakage and formation of sulfur-sulfur bonds, although interesting discoveries are now being made about the reac tivity of certain sulfur-carbon bonds.

Catalysis in C1 Chemistry,W. Keim,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Continuously increasing oil prices, a dwindling supply of petroleum, and the existence of extensive reserves of biomass, especially of coal, have given rise to a growing interest in generating CO/H from these sources. Catalytic reactions can 2 convert CO/H mixtures to useful hydrocarbons or hydrocarbon intermediates. 2 There is little doubt that petroleum will remain the backbone of the organic chemical industry for many years to come, yet there is great opportunity for CO as an alternative feedstock at times when it is needed. The loosely defined body of chemistry and technology contained in these areas of development has become known as C 1 chemistry, embracing many C 1 building blocks such as CH , CO/H , CO, CH OH, CO and HCN; still emphasis 4 2 3 2 rests on carbon monoxide. Academic research laboratories, oil and chemical companies are in the vanguard of C 1 chemistry.

Using conversational language and logically assembled graphics, the book concisely introduces each topic without overwhelming students with unnecessary detail. Example problems and end-of-chapter questions emphasize repetition of concepts, preparing students to become adept at the basics before they progress to an advanced general chemistry course. Enhanced with visualization techniques such as the first chapter's mythical microscope, the book clarifies challenging, abstract ideas and stimulates curiosity into what can otherwise be an overwhelming topic. Topics discussed in this reader-friendly text include: Properties and structure of matter Atoms, molecules, and compounds The Periodic Table Atomic weight, formula weights, and moles Gases and solutions Chemical equilibrium Acids, bases, and pH Organic chemicals The appendix contains answers to the homework exercises so students can check their work and receive instant feedback as to whether they have adequately grasped the concepts before moving on to the next section. Designed to help students embrace chemistry not with trepidation, but with confidence, this solid preparatory text forms a firm foundation for more advanced chemistry training.",1138402532,9781138402539,N/A,N/A,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=56URuQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=56URuQEACAAJ&dq=Chemistry&hl=&cd=300&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=56URuQEACAAJ&dq=Chemistry&hl=&source=gbs_api

The Physical Basis of Chemistry,Warren S. Warren,Elsevier,2013-10-22,"If the descriptive text youre using for teaching general chemistry seems to lack sufficient mathematics and physics to make the results of its presentation of classical mechanics, molecular structure, and statisticsunderstandable, youre not alone. Written to provide supplemental and mathematically challenging topics for the advanced lower-division undergraduate chemistry course, or the non-major, junior-level physical chemistry course, The Physical Basis of Chemistry will offer your students an opportunity to explore quantum mechanics, the Boltzmann distribution, and spectroscopy in a refreshingly compelling way.Posed and answered are questions concerning everyday phenomena: How can two discharging shotguns and two stereo speakers be used to contrast particles and waves? Why does a collision between one atom of gas and the wall of its container transfer momentum but not much energy? How does a microwave oven work? Why does carbon dioxide production heat the earth? Why are leaves green, water blue, and how do the eyes detect the difference? Unlike other texts on this subject, however, The Physical Basis of Chemistry deals directly with the substance of these questions, avoiding the use of predigested material more appropriate for memorization exercises than for actual concrete learning. The only prerequisite is first-semester calculus, or familiarity withderivatives of one variable.Provides a concise, logical introduction to physical chemistryFeatures carefully worked-out sample problems at the end of each chapterIncludes more detailed and clearly explained coverage of quantum mechanics and statistics than found in other textsAvailable in an affordable paperback editionDesigned specifically as a supplementary text for advanced/honors chemistry coursesUses SI units throughout",1483293688,9781483293684,183,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iFEXBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=iFEXBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Chemistry&hl=&cd=309&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iFEXBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Chemistry in the Kitchen Garden,James R Hanson,Royal Society of Chemistry,2015-11-09,"Over the past decade there has been a resurgence of interest in growing fruit and vegetables in the garden and on the allotment. Part of the driving force behind this is an increased awareness of the health benefits that can be derived from fruit and vegetables in the diet. The 'five helpings a day' dictum reflects the correlation between a regular consumption of fruit and vegetables and a reduced incidence of, for example, cardiovascular disease and some cancers. Growing your own vegetables provides the opportunity to harvest them at their peak, to minimize the time for post-harvest deterioration prior to consumption and to reduce their 'food miles'. It also provides an opportunity to grow interesting and less common cultivars. The combination of economic advantages and recreational factors add to the pleasure of growing fruit and vegetables. This book covers the natural products that have been identified in common 'home-grown' fruit and vegetables and which contribute to their organoleptic and beneficial properties. Over the last fifty years the immense advances in separation methods and spectroscopic techniques for structure elucidation have led to the identification of a wide range of natural products in fruit and vegetables. Not only have many of their beneficial properties been recognized but also their ecological roles in the development of plants have been identified. The functional role of many of these natural products is to mediate the balance between an organism and its environment in terms of microbial, herbivore or plant to plant interactions. The book is aimed at readers with a chemical background who wish to know a little more about the natural products that they are eating, their beneficial effects, and the roles that these compounds have in nature. Developments in the understanding of the ecological and beneficial chemistry of fruit and vegetables have made the exploration of their chemical diversity a fascinating and expanding area of natural product chemistry and readers will obtain some 'taste' for this chemistry from the book. It develops in more detail the relevant sections from the earlier RSC book 'Chemistry in the Garden'. The book begins with an outline of the major groups of compound that are found in fruit and vegetables. This is followed by a description of aspects of environmental chemistry that contribute to the successful cultivation of these crops. Subsequent chapters deal with individual plants which are grouped in terms of the part of the plant, roots, bulbs and stems, leaves, seeds, that are used for food. The final chapters deal with fruit and herbs. The epilogue considers some general aspects of ecological chemistry and climatic stress which may, in the future, affect the growth of fruit and vegetables in the garden particularly in the context of potential climate changes. The book concludes with a section on further reading, a glossary of terms used in plant chemistry and a list of the common fruit and vegetables grouped in their plant families.",1782625836,9781782625834,191,Gardening,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kmsoDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=kmsoDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Chemistry&hl=&cd=316&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=kmsoDwAAQBAJ&dq=Chemistry&hl=&source=gbs_api

Environmental Chemistry of Dyes and Pigments,"Abraham Reife, Harold S. Freeman",John Wiley & Sons,1996-01-05,"In the last two decades the EPA and other national andinternational agencies have placed increasingly strict regulationson the manufacture and use of synthetic colorants. The pigment anddye industry has had to develop the technology necessary to analyzeand remediate pollutants in wastewater. Although these efforts haveproduced a considerable volume of information, until now, no singlebook has provided an organized, comprehensive treatment of theenvironmental chemistry of synthetic colorants. Environmental Chemistry of Dyes and Pigments is the firstcomprehensive reference to address the environmental problems posedby synthetic colorants, and to provide a forum for the solutionsproposed by industry, government, and academia. Focusing ondevelopments in the field over the past two decades, it deals withall aspects of colored wastewater treatment, the disposal of dyes,analytical methods, toxicity, and regulatory questions. In its coverage of wastewater treatment, this book addresses boththe most commonly used methods and those specifically designed toaddress pollution problems at the source by analyzing for andremoving dyes and pollutants from wastewater effluent. Throughout,real-world data on a wide variety of dyes and dye intermediates isprovided, as well as cost-effective strategies for dealing withwastewater treatment. In addition, several chapters are devoted to the perspectives ofnational and international experts on regulations governing themanufacture, handling, use, and disposal of synthetic dyes andpigments. The impact these regulations have had on both U.S. andforeign industry is also discussed. A complete, comprehensive, and up-to-date guide to pollutionprevention in the dyestuff and textile industries Environmental Chemistry of Dyes and Pigments is the onlyself-contained volume that focuses on the environmental impact ofsynthetic dyes and pigments.

Insights into the Chemistry of Organic Structure-Directing Agents in the Synthesis of Zeolitic Materials,Luis Gómez-Hortigüela,Springer,2018-03-31,"This edited volume focuses on the host-guest chemistry of organic molecules and inorganic systems during synthesis (structure-direction). Organic molecules have been used for many years in the synthesis of zeolitic nanoporous frameworks. The addition of these organic molecules to the zeolite synthesis mixtures provokes a particular ordering of the inorganic units around them that directs the crystallization pathway towards a particular framework type; hence they are called structure-directing agents. Their use has allowed the discovery of an extremely large number of new zeolite frameworks and compositions. This volume covers the main aspects of the use of organic molecules as structure-directing agents for the synthesis of zeolites, including first an introduction of the main concepts, then two chapters covering state-of-the-art techniques currently used to understand the structure-directing phenomenon (location of molecules by XRD and molecular modeling techniques). The most recent trends in the types of organic molecules used as structure-directing agents are also presented, including the use of metal-complexes, the use of non-ammonium-based molecules (mainly phosphorus-based compounds) and the role of supramolecular chemistry in designing new large organic structure-directing agents produced by self-aggregation. In addition the volume explores the latest research attempting to transfer the asymmetric nature of organic chiral molecules used as structure-directing agents to the zeolite lattice to produce chiral enantioselective frameworks, one of the biggest challenges today in materials chemistry. This volume has interdisciplinary appeal and will engage scholars from the zeolite community with a general interest in microporous materials, which involves not only zeolite scientists, but also researchers working on metal-organic framework materials. The concepts covered will also be of interest for researchers working on the application of materials after encapsulation of molecules of interest in post-synthetic treatments.

Hardly ever does an organic synthesis advance according to plan. Diligently designed synthetic schemes stumble upon the laboratory reality of meagre yields, side reactions, and unwanted products. To fight against that we have a magnificent intellectual tool: reaction mechanisms. In the course of an undergraduate degree, the student assimilates an assortment of unadorned reaction mechanisms, when in professional practice she/he needs to envision convoluted mechanisms resulting from the sequential operation of simple steps. The student here is like the novice chess player who knows how to move the pieces, but not how to play the game.

Milestones in Microwave Chemistry,György Keglevich,Springer,2016-03-30,"This book looks back on thirty-five years of microwave (MW) chemistry and explains how the application of the MW technique became an integral part of R&D, eventually becoming recognized in industry. Further, it details how MW chemistry has undergone a dynamic development in the past three decades, one driven by the advent of increasingly sophisticated professional MW reactors in place of the kitchen MW ovens used in earlier years. A major part of the book shows how substitutions, esterifications, amidations, hydrolyses, alkylations, eliminations, dehydrations, condensations, cyclizations, C–C couplings and the modification of heterocycles can be performed advantageously under MW irradiation, as the reaction times are shorter, while the selectivity and yields are higher; it also explains why in most cases, the reactions can be performed under solvent-free conditions. MW irradiation within the sphere of organophosphorus chemistry is showcased and typical reactions, such as the direct derivatization of phosphinic acids, alkylating esterifications, Diels–Alder reactions, the inverse Wittig-type reaction, fragmentations, the Arbuzov reaction, the synthesis of α-hydroxyphosphonates and α-aminophosphonates (the Kabachnik–Fields condensation), deoxygenations and P–C coupling reactions are described under MW conditions.

Octanol-Water Partition Coefficients,James M. Sangster,John Wiley & Sons,1997-05-28,"The octanol-water partition coefficient is a laboratory-measured property of a substance. It provides a thermodynamic measure of the tendency of the substance to prefer a non-aqueous or oily milieu rather than water (i.e. its hydrophilic/lipophilic balance). Partition coefficients are used extensively in medicinal chemistry, drug design, ecotoxicology and environmental chemistry. The partition coefficient is recognized by governmental and international agencies (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, OECD) as a physical property of organic pollutants equal in importance to vapour pressure, water solubility and toxicity. Octanol-Water Partition Coefficients is a comprehensive and up-to-date survey of the thermodynamics of partitioning and of the octanol-water pair. In addition, all current methods of measurement are reviewed, strengths and weaknesses are noted and recommendations for particular applications are given. Current methods of calculation of partition coefficients are similarly surveyed and described. Five of the most popular computerized methods are tested for predictive accuracy for drugs, pollutants, aminoacids, etc. The book will be of interest not only to solution chemists, but to any chemists who use partition coefficients. It provides a thorough understanding of the fundamentals and offers clear guidance on the choice of methods of measurement and calculation.

Applied Food Protein Chemistry,Zeynep Ustunol,John Wiley & Sons,2014-12-19,"Food proteins are of great interest, not only because of their nutritional importance and their functionality in foods, but also for their detrimental effects. Although proteins from milk, meats (including fish and poultry), eggs, cereals, legumes, and oilseeds have been the traditional sources of protein in the human diet, potentially any proteins from a biological source could serve as a food protein. The primary role of protein in the diet is to provide the building materials for the synthesis of muscle and other tissues, and they play a critical role in many biological processes. They are also responsible for food texture, color, and flavor. Today, food proteins are extracted, modified, and incorporated into processed foods to impart specific functional properties. They can also have adverse effects in the diet: proteins, such as walnuts, pecans, almonds, and cashews, soybean, wheat, milk, egg, crustacean, and fish proteins can be powerful allergens for some people. Applied Food Protein Chemistry is an applied reference which reviews the properties of food proteins and provides in-depth information on important plant and animal proteins consumed around the world. The book is grouped into three sections: (1) overview of food proteins, (2) plant proteins, and (3) animal proteins. Each chapter discusses world production, distribution, utilization, physicochemical properties, and the functional properties of each protein, as well as its food applications. The authors for each of the chapters are carefully selected experts in the field. This book will be a valuable reference tool for those who work on food proteins. It will also be an important text on applied food protein chemistry for upper-level students and graduate students of food science programs.",1118860616,9781118860618,526,Technology & Engineering,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kBruBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=kBruBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Chemistry&hl=&cd=403&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kBruBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api
Principles and Applications of Density Functional Theory in Inorganic Chemistry II,"N. Kaltsoyannis, J.E. McGrady",Springer,2004-08-19,"It is difficult to overestimate the impact that density functional theory has had on computational quantum chemistry over the last two decades. Indeed, this period has seen it grow from little more than a theoreticalcuriosity to become a central tool in the computational chemist s armoury. Arguably no area of ch- istry has benefited more from the meteoric rise in density functional theory than inorganic chemistry. the ability to obtainreliable results in feasible ti- scales on systems containing heavy elements such as the d and f transition - tals has led to an enormous growth in computational inorganic chemistry. The inorganic chemical literature reflects this growth; it is almost impossible to open a modern inorganic chemistry journal without finding several papers devoted exclusively or in part to density functional theory calculations. The real imp- tance of the rise in density functional theory in inorganic chemistry is undou- edly the much closer synergy between theory and experiment than was p- viously posible. In these volumes, world-leading researchers describe recent developments in the density functional theory and its applications in modern inorganic and b- inorganic chemistry. These articles address key issues key issues in both sol- state and molecular inorganic chemistry, such as spectroscopy, mechanisms, catalysis, bonding and magnetism.
