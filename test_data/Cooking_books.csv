Look Who's Cooking,Jennifer Rachel Dutch,Univ. Press of Mississippi,2018-08-03,"Home cooking is a multibillion-dollar industry that includes cookbooks, kitchen gadgets, high-end appliances, specialty ingredients, and more. Cooking-themed programming flourishes on television, inspiring a wide array of celebrity chef–branded goods even as self-described “foodies” seek authenticity by pickling, preserving, and canning foods in their own home kitchens. Despite this, claims that “no one has time to cook anymore” are common, lamenting the slow extinction of traditional American home cooking in the twenty-first century. In Look Who's Cooking: The Rhetoric of American Home Cooking Traditions in the Twenty-First Century, author Jennifer Rachel Dutch explores the death-of-home-cooking narrative, revealing how modern changes transformed cooking at home from an odious chore into a concept imbued with deep meanings associated with home, family, and community. Drawing on a wide array of texts—cookbooks, advertising, YouTube videos, and more—Dutch analyzes the many manifestations of traditional cooking in America today. She argues that what is missing from the discourse around home cooking is an understanding of skills and recipes as a form of folklore. Dutch’s research reveals that home cooking is a powerful vessel that Americans fill with meaning because it represents both the continuity of the past and adaptability to the present. Home cooking is about much more than what is for dinner; it’s about forging a connection to the past, displaying the self in the present, and leaving a lasting legacy for the future.",1496818768,9781496818768,188,Social Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XD5nDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=XD5nDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT137&dq=Cooking&hl=&cd=17&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XD5nDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

The Menial Art of Cooking,"Sarah R. Graff, Enrique Rodríguez-Alegría",University Press of Colorado,2012-05-15,"Although the archaeology of food has long played an integral role in our understanding of past cultures, the archaeology of cooking is rarely integrated into models of the past. The cooks who spent countless hours cooking and processing food are overlooked and the forgotten players in the daily lives of our ancestors. The Menial Art of Cooking shows how cooking activities provide a window into other aspects of society and, as such, should be taken seriously as an aspect of social, cultural, political, and economic life. This book examines techniques and technologies of food preparation, the spaces where food was cooked, the relationship between cooking and changes in suprahousehold economies, the religious and symbolic aspects of cooking, the relationship between cooking and social identity, and how examining foodways provides insight into social relations of production, distribution, and consumption. Contributors use a wide variety of evidence—including archaeological data; archival research; analysis of ceramics, fauna, botany, glass artifacts, stone tools, murals, and painted ceramics; ethnographic analogy; and the distribution of artifacts across space—to identify evidence of cooking and food processing left by ancient cooks. The Menial Art of Cooking is the first archaeological volume focused on cooking and food preparation in prehistoric and historic settings around the world and will interest archaeologists, social anthropologists, sociologists, and other scholars studying cooking and food preparation or subsistence.",1457117479,9781457117473,269,Social Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Fcm9AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=Fcm9AwAAQBAJ&pg=PT302&dq=Cooking&hl=&cd=24&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=Fcm9AwAAQBAJ&dq=Cooking&hl=&source=gbs_api
Cooking Lessons,Sherrie A. Inness,Rowman & Littlefield,2001,"Meatloaf, fried chicken, Jell-O, cake--because foods are so very common, we rarely think about them much in depth. The authors of Cooking Lessons however, believe that food is deserving of our critical scrutiny and that such analysis yields many important lessons about American society and its values. This book explores the relationship between food and gender. Contributors draw from diverse sources, both contemporary and historical, and look at women from various cultural backgrounds, including Hispanic, traditional southern White, and African American. Each chapter focuses on a certain food, teasing out its cultural meanings and showing its effect on women's identity and lives. For example, food has often offered women a traditional way to gain power and influence in their households and larger communities. For women without access to other forms of creative expression, preparing a superior cake or batch of fried chicken was a traditional way to display their talent in an acceptable venue.

Cooking Meat,Peter Sanagan,Appetite by Random House,2020-10-20,"“Standing slow clap for this masterwork by Peter Sanagan. A better, more comprehensive book on meat and cooking has not been written. A stunning accomplishment.” --Dave McMillan and Frederic Morin, Joe Beef A cookbook to turn passionate meat lovers into confident meat cooks, with more than 120 deliciously meaty recipes from butcher and chef, Peter Sanagan. COOKING MEAT is a meat-lover's guide to everything there is to know about meat, written by Peter Sanagan--chef by training, butcher by trade--who has cooked just about every cut of meat available. From information on sustainable, responsible farming to understanding the different cuts of meats for sale (and what their labels really mean), Cooking Meat is an insider's look at choosing, buying, prepping, cutting, and cooking meat. Inside are more than 120 recipes, from childhood-inspired favorites, like Meatballs, Crispy Baked Chicken Wings, and Memphis-Style Barbecued Side Ribs, to classic comfort food, like Fried Chicken and Steak and Ale Pie, and from elevated cuisine like Duck Confit and international favorites like Lamb Biryani, to simple pared-back dishes like Roasted Fresh Ham. Also included are step-by-step basic butchery techniques, as well as detailed methods for meaty challenges like stuffing your own sausages, cooking a flawless steak, carving poultry, making bacon, and (the number one question a butcher is asked!) roasting the perfect chicken. With a master guide for every common cut of meat, along with the best cooking methods to pair with them (from roasting to braising to grilling to sous viding to pressure cooking), Peter gives you the tools to determine what type of meat you want to cook, and how to get the best results every time. In Cooking Meat, you'll discover an invaluable reference, like a guided tour of the butcher's case, written with one goal: to turn meat lovers into meat cooks.",0525610359,9780525610359,715,Cooking,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=izXMDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=izXMDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Cooking&hl=&cd=109&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=izXMDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Kitchen Secrets,Frances Short,Berg Publishers,2006-04,"What's really going on in the kitchen?Whilst cookery programmes are broadcast at peak viewing times and chefs regularly claim celebrity status, food writers announce the death of cooking. Parents, experts, campaigners and policymakers grow increasingly concerned about the proliferation of pre-prepared foods and a growing trend for eating alone and on the run. Kitchen Secrets explores the thoughts, values and opinions of home cooks, their practices and experiences, and the skills and knowledge they use to prepare and provide food. It offers new and challenging ways of thinking about cooking, examining and often contesting commonly-held beliefs and theories about the role of practical cookery lessons, dinner parties as showcases for culinary flair and the de-skilling effect of convenience foods. Kitchen Secrets lifts the lid on the modern range to see what's cooking.",1845202767,9781845202767,180,Cooking,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QzRSngr1Mu4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=QzRSngr1Mu4C&dq=Cooking&hl=&cd=180&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=QzRSngr1Mu4C&dq=Cooking&hl=&source=gbs_api

Wild Cooking,Richard Mabey,Random House,2012-03-31,"Sequel to the cult bestseller Food For Free, Wild Cooking is about making-do and the sheer fun of inventive cooking. Richard Mabey's sparky, offbeat book is about canny and inventive making-do, or 'busking in the kitchen'. Whether creating a cassoulet, which uses English ingredients, making bread from chestnuts or slow-cooking a Peking duck in front of an ancient fan heater, he encourages us to be daring and imaginative in our cooking and our approach to food. Although it contains wonderful, mouth-watering recipes like broad bean hummus, pumpkin soup and fillet-steak hearts this is more than a recipe book - it is a guide to a whole new way of thinking that embraces scrumping, celebrates picnics, and revels in saving energy wherever it can, whether that's by one-pot feasts or cooling on car radiators. After all, if you care about food 'life's too short not to stuff a mushroom'.

Food and Cooking Skills Education,Anita Tull,Routledge,2018-01-29,"Food and Cooking Skills Education (FCSE) is a complex mix of policy and practicality, educational theory and pedagogy, classroom and government policy. This book shows how FCSE has been at the centre of a tussle between education and policy for decades. It reviews how FCSE has grappled with various significant issues of concern that threaten to marginalise it and pose problems for educational practicalities, as expectations are increased, but resources are squeezed. It assesses the debate about the significance and importance of acquiring practical food and cooking skills in a society where the purchase of ready-made food has become commonplace, and public knowledge of where our food comes from is noticeably lacking. This has contributed to the escalating incidence of diet-related diseases and the attendant cost to society, and threatened environmental sustainability. In turn, governments have reacted by proposals to make practical cooking skills a statutory National Curriculum subject as part of the armoury for tackling such costs. Based on detailed research conducted across England and Wales, as well as comparisons with thirty-five other countries or states, the author makes recommendations for policy to manage this challenge facing contemporary society.",1315313871,9781315313870,188,Cooking,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nilKDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=nilKDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Cooking&hl=&cd=215&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nilKDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

"Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat",Samin Nosrat,Simon and Schuster,2017-04-25,"Now a Netflix series New York Times Bestseller and Winner of the 2018 James Beard Award for Best General Cookbook and multiple IACP Cookbook Awards Named one of the Best Books of 2017 by: NPR, BuzzFeed, The Atlantic, The Washington Post, Chicago Tribune, Rachel Ray Every Day, San Francisco Chronicle, Vice Munchies, Elle.com, Glamour, Eater, Newsday, Minneapolis Star Tribune, The Seattle Times, Tampa Bay Times, Tasting Table, Modern Farmer, Publishers Weekly, and more. A visionary new master class in cooking that distills decades of professional experience into just four simple elements, from the woman declared ""America's next great cooking teacher"" by Alice Waters. In the tradition of The Joy of Cooking and How to Cook Everything comes Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat, an ambitious new approach to cooking by a major new culinary voice. Chef and writer Samin Nosrat has taught everyone from professional chefs to middle school kids to author Michael Pollan to cook using her revolutionary, yet simple, philosophy. Master the use of just four elements--Salt, which enhances flavor; Fat, which delivers flavor and generates texture; Acid, which balances flavor; and Heat, which ultimately determines the texture of food--and anything you cook will be delicious. By explaining the hows and whys of good cooking, Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat will teach and inspire a new generation of cooks how to confidently make better decisions in the kitchen and cook delicious meals with any ingredients, anywhere, at any time. Echoing Samin's own journey from culinary novice to award-winning chef, Salt, Fat Acid, Heat immediately bridges the gap between home and professional kitchens. With charming narrative, illustrated walkthroughs, and a lighthearted approach to kitchen science, Samin demystifies the four elements of good cooking for everyone. Refer to the canon of 100 essential recipes--and dozens of variations--to put the lessons into practice and make bright, balanced vinaigrettes, perfectly caramelized roast vegetables, tender braised meats, and light, flaky pastry doughs.

Pulp,Abra Berens,Chronicle Books,2023-04-04,"Named a Best Cookbook of Spring 2023 by Eater, Food & Wine, and more, and a Best Cookbook of the Year by Epicurious, Vice, Library Journal, and more. First vegetables, then grains, and now, fruit. This is the beautiful follow-up to Abra Berens's Ruffage and Grist, with more than 215 recipes and variations for using fruit in sweet and savory recipes to highlight seasonality and flavor. Pulp is a hardworking book of recipes that focuses on all the ways fruit can enhance simple, delicious mains—for example, by elevating roasted vegetables, garnishing soup, or adding perfume to a roasted pork or brisket. Unlike Ruffage and Grist, Pulp is about regularly incorporating fruit to add variety and seasonality to main dishes. Home cooks and bakers alike will rejoice in the alternately sweet and savory recipes such as Roast Chicken over Blueberries, Cornbread + Lemon; Melon, Cucumber + Chickpea Salad; and Rum-Plum Clafoutis. The book also features helpful reference material, a Baker's Toolkit, and more than 100 atmospheric photos, delivered with the can-do attitude and accessibility of the Midwestern United States. This next generous offering from beloved, trusted author Abra Berens is a necessary addition to any kitchen shelf alongside its predecessors and other mainstays like Plenty, Six Seasons, and Small Victories. THIS IS THE A TO Z OF FRUIT: The content is deep and authoritative, but also wide-ranging, with information and recipes for 15 different, widely accessible fruit varieties: Apples, Apricots, Blueberries, Cherries, Drupelet Berries (blackberries, raspberries, mulberries), Grapes, Ground Cherries (a.k.a. cape gooseberries), Melons, Nectarines + Peaches, Pears, Plums, Quince, Rhubarb, Strawberries, and Tart Round Fruits (cranberries, currants, gooseberries, lingonberries + autumn olive). Pulp features only fruits that grow in the Midwestern United States, so no bananas, passion fruit, or citrus here. CULINARY REFERENCE BOOK: Like Ruffage and Grist before it, Pulp is a truly useful reference cookbook. Organized by type of fruit, each chapter offers authoritative info and tips that the home cook can use to deepen their knowledge of ingredients and broaden their repertoire of techniques—all in the service of improving their meals. The recipes are simple, generally quick to prepare, and use ingredients that are easy to find and often already in your pantry. Plus, the many variations empower home cooks to flex their creativity and trust themselves in the kitchen. ONGOING SUCCESS: Ruffage was named a Best Cookbook for Spring 2019 by the New York Times and Bon Appétit, was a 2020 Michigan Notable Book winner, and was nominated for a 2019 James Beard Award. Grist was named a Best Cookbook for Fall 2021 by Eater and received a starred review from Publishers Weekly. Here's some strong praise for both books: ""Things in my kitchen have changed since Ruffage arrived. This organized, easygoing guide to 29 vegetables offers a few cooking methods for each one, supplemented by several variations."" —Kim Severson, New York Times ""[Ruffage] is a total classic in the making.""—Christina Chaey, associate editor, Bon Appétit ""Crammed with exciting ideas that encourage creativity, this lively book will quickly become an essential item in the home cook's library.""—Library Journal (starred review) ""[In Grist,] Berens encourages readers to start with ingredients they're excited about. . . . Interspersed features highlight working farmers and their areas of specialty, serving to illustrate issues that inform Berens's ethics and worldview."" —Booklist ""[In Grist,] Berens strolls through each category with representative methods (such as boiled, fried, and sprouted) with an eye toward variety and versatility over 125 recipes.""—Chicago Reader DISTINCTIVE: In a super-chunky package (432 pages!) brimming with photos and accessible, delicious recipes, Pulp is not just a reference cookbook but a beautiful one at that. The three cookbooks are perfect for gifting together as a set to a lucky friend. Perfect for: Recreational cooks of all skill levels, from beginners looking to master a few dependable techniques to seasoned cooks who want recipes and strategies for easy weeknight meals with more healthy ingredients Plus for bakers: One third of Pulp's content is baking recipes!

Vietnamese Home Cooking,Charles Phan,Ten Speed Press,2012-09-25,"In his eagerly awaited first cookbook, award-winning chef Charles Phan from San Francisco's Slanted Door restaurant introduces traditional Vietnamese cooking to home cooks by focusing on fundamental techniques and ingredients. When Charles Phan opened his now-legendary restaurant, The Slanted Door, in 1995, he introduced American diners to a new world of Vietnamese food: robustly flavored, subtly nuanced, authentic yet influenced by local ingredients, and, ultimately, entirely approachable. In this same spirit of tradition and innovation, Phan presents a landmark collection based on the premise that with an understanding of its central techniques and fundamental ingredients, Vietnamese home cooking can be as attainable and understandable as American, French, or Italian. With solid instruction and encouraging guidance, perfectly crispy imperial rolls, tender steamed dumplings, delicately flavored whole fish, and meaty lemongrass beef stew are all deliciously close at hand. Abundant photography detailing techniques and equipment, and vibrant shots taken on location in Vietnam, make for equal parts elucidation and inspiration. And with master recipes for stocks and sauces, a photographic guide to ingredients, and tips on choosing a wok and seasoning a clay pot, this definitive reference will finally secure Vietnamese food in the home cook’s repertoire. Infused with the author’s stories and experiences, from his early days as a refugee to his current culinary success, Vietnamese Home Cooking is a personal and accessible guide to real Vietnamese cuisine from one of its leading voices.",160774385X,9781607743859,258,Cooking,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=z8EyMO5JIKkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=z8EyMO5JIKkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Cooking&hl=&cd=275&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=z8EyMO5JIKkC&source=gbs_api

Cooking as a Chemical Reaction,Z. Sibel Ozilgen,CRC Press,2019-06-18,"With this book, students are able to perform experiments and then make observations that they will frequently see in the kitchen and other food preparation and processing areas and learn the science behind these phenomena. The second edition of Cooking as a Chemical Reaction: Culinary Science with Experiments features new chapters on food hygiene and safety, kitchen terminology, and taste pairing, as well as an expanded chapter on the role of food additives in culinary transformations. The text uses experiments and experiences from the kitchen, and other food preparation areas, rather than theory, as the basic means of explaining the scientific facts and principles behind food preparation and food processing. It engages students in their own learning process. This textbook is designed so that students can first perform certain experiments and record their observations in tables provided in the book. The book then explains the science behind their observations. Features: Experiments and recipes form the basic means of teaching culinary chemistry Features new chapters on food hygiene and safety, kitchen terminology, and taste pairing Employs real kitchen practices to explain the subjects Covers traditional food chemistry including water in culinary transformations, protein, carbohydrates, fats, sensorial properties Many concepts throughout the book are marked with a symbol that indicates the concept is one that they will come across frequently not just in this text, but in the kitchen and other food preparation and processing areas. A second symbol precedes the scientific explanation of the observation made during the experiments in the chapter. At the end of each chapter, students are presented with important points to remember, more ideas to try, and study questions to reinforce concepts that were presented in the chapter. The book is designed for each chapter to be read and studied in chronological order, as the concepts of each chapter will reoccur in subsequent chapters. Written at the undergraduate level, this book is designed for students in culinary arts, nutrition, dietetics, food science and technology, and gastronomy programs. It is intended for students with limited scientific background who are studying different aspects of food preparation and processing.",0429944918,9780429944918,411,Health & Fitness,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=d0-fDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=d0-fDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Cooking&hl=&cd=289&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=d0-fDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Cooking for One,Amy Willcock,Random House,2009-10-06,"Living on one's own is just as likely to be a matter of choice as not and the numbers adopting this lifestyle are increasing all the time. Yet the joys of cooking for one - it takes less time, washing up is minimal, and you can indulge yourself with cuts such as fillet steak which for larger numbers would be prohibitively expensive - are frequently overlooked. The 150 specially devised recipes included here, such as Chicken Milanese, Salt and Pepper Prawns, Baby Pumpkin Gratin and Baked Eggs with Spinach, focus on what the single person really wants to eat - quick and easy last-minute suppers and mid-week treats to lazy weekend meals - not cut-down recipes for four.

The Food and Cooking of Peru,Flor Arcaya De Deliot,Aquamarine,2010-01-25,"Discover the rich and vibrant food and cooking of Peru, one of the most delicious, distinctive and ancient cuisines of the world Explore the fascinating origins of Peruvian food, from its roots in the Inca culture, through the rich inheritance of the Spanish conquistadors, and the later influences of African, Italian, French and Chinese immigrants An introduction to Peru's culinary traditions includes a guide to local ingredients from chilies, corn and potatoes to cassava, quinoa and fresh cheese A fantastic collection of over 65 authentic recipes including specialties from the rich coastal region, the Andean mountain range, the mysterious rainforest, and the bustling cities Illustrated with more than 400 stunning photographs, each recipe comes with step-by-step instruction and complete nutritional information Peruvian cuisine is considered to be one of the most diverse in the world. Thanks to its Inca origins and to Spanish, African, Sino-Cantonese, Japanese and finally Italian and French immigration, Peruvian cooking combines the flavors of four continents. With such a variety of traditional dishes, 28 different climates, and terrain that includes coasts, mountains, forest and jungle, Peruvian gastronomy is in constant evolution. Inca cuisine is still present in Peruvian cooking, mostly in the use of maize, potatoes, yucca and chillies - the much-loved Peruvian tamales date back to the Incas. This Andean inheritance was incorporated into the food traditions of the Spanish conquistadors in the 16th century, and by the waves of immigrants that have arrived in Peru ever since. Ceviche, one of Peru's most popular dishes, perfectly defines this fusion of Peruvian cooking: fresh fish from Peru's rich coastal fishing areas, mixed with Andean peppers, and onions from Spain, marinated in lemon juice from North Africa, and served Inca-style with potatoes and maize. Including well-known favorites, such as chicharrones (mouthwatering fried pork), empanadas (irresistible little pastries), and humitas and butifarras (tempting street-food snacks), this book also introduces dishes that have yet to travel further than the borders of Peru. These include satisfying and tasty soups that are meals in themselves; delicious corn, potato and bean side dishes; fish in tangy, spicy sauces; meat, richly flavored with chilies; and indulgent desserts that reflect the Peruvian love of sweet things. Peru's cuisine is a unique blend of the ancient with the modern; fueled by an abundance of natural ingredients; and inspired by different cooking traditions. With this book you can feast on food that combines the old world with the new, and explore the very best of one of an intriguing culinary inheritance.",1903141680,9781903141687,128,Cooking,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ayr0PAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=ayr0PAAACAAJ&dq=Cooking&hl=&cd=294&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=ayr0PAAACAAJ&dq=Cooking&hl=&source=gbs_api

The Appledore Cook Book,Maria Parloa,Andrews McMeel Publishing,2013-07-16,"Published in 1872 in Boston, The Appledore Cook Book was authored by renowned cooking teacher and writer Maria Parloa to be a go-to cookbook for new brides and housekeepers, and it was specifically geared toward simpler recipes with less expensive ingredients. This first of many cookbooks by Parloa was inspired by her time spent cooking at the Appledore House hotel on the Isles of Shoals, Maine. The Appledore Cook Book contains the first known recipe for tomato chowder (known today as tomato soup) as well as delectable family-sized recipes such as Lamb Chops, Dumplings for Soup, Baked Potatoes, Fried Ham, Buckwheat Cakes, Apple Cake, Ginger Snaps, and Pumpkin Pie. Emphasizing the purpose of this popular cookbook, Parloa states in the preface, “The great trouble with all the cook books which I have known . . . is, that they are too expensive, and that they use weight instead of measure, and also that they take for granted that the young housekeeper knows many things which she really does not.” With The Appledore Cook Book, Parloa provides just such a cookbook of simple-yet-tasty, inexpensive meals—a theme as popular in the 19th century as it is today. This edition of The Appledore Cook Book was reproduced by permission from the volume in the collection of the American Antiquarian Society, Worcester, Massachusetts. Founded in 1812 by Isaiah Thomas, a Revolutionary War patriot and successful printer and publisher, the society is a research library documenting the lives of Americans from the colonial era through 1876. The society collects, preserves, and makes available as complete a record as possible of the printed materials from the early American experience. The cookbook collection comprises approximately 1,100 volumes.",1449432077,9781449432072,139,Cooking,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eunplCyCywoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=eunplCyCywoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Cooking&hl=&cd=321&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eunplCyCywoC&source=gbs_api

Now he shares his most personal thoughts about cooking in his long-awaited book, Cooking by Hand. In this groundbreaking collection of essays and recipes, Bertolli evocatively explores the philosophy behind the food that Molly O’Neill of the New York Times described as “deceptively simple, [with] favors clean, deep, and layered more profusely than a mille-feuille.” From “Twelve Ways of Looking at Tomatoes” to Italian salumi in “The Whole Hog,” Bertolli explores his favorite foods with the vividness of a natural writer and the instincts of a superlative chef. Scattered throughout are more than 140 recipes remarkable for their clarity, simplicity, and seductive appeal, from Salad of Bitter Greens, Walnuts, Tesa, and Parmigiano and Chilled Shellfish with Salsa Verde to Short Ribs Agrodolce and Tagliolini Pasta with Crab.

Eva's Kitchen,"Eva Longoria, Marah Stets",Clarkson Potter,2011-04-05,"Eva Longoria may be most recognized for her role as Desperate Housewives’ saucy Gabrielle Solis, but on her own time, there are few places she would rather be than in the kitchen, cooking the food she loves for her family and friends. The recipes in Eva’s Kitchen trace her life story, taking readers on her culinary journey—from the food she was brought up on to the recipes inspired by her travels abroad to the dishes she serves during casual nights at home. Eva believes that good cooking relies on local, fresh, easy-to-find ingredients. Offering 100 of her favorite dishes—many of which are family recipes collected over the years—all fused with her passion for cooking, Eva teaches readers essential cooking skills and she sprinkles in the histories and traditions behind her favorite dishes, including personal stories and anecdotes that capture the warmth, humor, and joy of her most memorable meals. Inspired by her heritage, Eva highlights the essentials of great Mexican cooking, Texas style—with her family’s recipes and techniques for making the world’s best tamales, homemade tortillas, Spanish rice, and Pan de Polvo (Mexican pastry), to name a few. She also offers dishes from a variety of international cuisines, from Latin American to Italian and French, inspired by her globe-trotting travels. A taste of Lemon Dover Sole whisks Eva to a tiny hotel-restaurant she once visited on a trip to Normandy; the recipe for Cannellini Beans with Crushed Red Pepper was a souvenir from a trip to Florence; kimchi adds a kick to her Spicy Roasted Brussels Sprouts, a Thanksgiving staple; and Yellow Squash Soup with Lemon brings her full circle, back to her family’s vegetable garden in Corpus Christi. With full-color food photographs, intimate portraits of her family and friends, and a glimpse into Eva’s home and her lesser-known domestic side (family first, acting second, she says), Eva’s debut cookbook will entice her loyal fans and inspire home cooks to broaden their culinary horizons and create memorable meals for the people they love.",0307952258,9780307952257,226,Cooking,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Qkc_zrgJyl8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,5,1,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=Qkc_zrgJyl8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Cooking&hl=&cd=325&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Qkc_zrgJyl8C&source=gbs_api

Cooking Science,"Castells, Pere, Josep Perelló",Actar,2010,"Condensed matter. Cooking science invites us to look at cooking, gastronomy and nutrition through the scientist's eyes and see them as a truly cultural activity which brings a wealth of knowledge into play. Challenging the predominance of visual culture, our eating habits and the pleasure of food privilege the senses of taste, touch, smell and even hearing. Perception and landscape define our cooking, but cooking also has a component of reflection and innovation based on scientific and technological research.

Cooking up Big Savings,Mike Maynes,iUniverse,2009-12-30,"Certified Financial Planner practitioner Mike Maynes will show you how to accomplish money-saving techniques in all phases of the shopping and cooking process. Because eating will always be a necessity to satisfy a basic human survival instinct, drastically cutting back on daily food consumption to save money is not a viable long-term solution.

Classico e Moderno,"Michael White, Andrew Friedman",Ballantine Books,2013-11-05,"NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY PUBLISHERS WEEKLY Having won or been nominated for just about every known prestigious culinary award, Michael White is hailed by food critics as the next great hero of Italian gastronomy. His reach extends around the globe with a clutch of acclaimed fine dining restaurants, including Marea, Ai Fiori, Osteria Morini, and pizzeria Nicoletta. Now, in Classico e Moderno, White brings his passion for authentic Italian cuisine to the home kitchen, with recipes—nearly 250—that cover both the traditional and contemporary dishes of the region. In the “Classico” portion, White shares such iconic dishes as Meatballs Braised in Tomato Sauce; Pasta and Bean Soup; Cavatelli with Lamb Ragù and Bell Peppers; and Roasted Pork Leg with Rosemary and Black Pepper. The “Moderno” chapters feature recipes that have put White’s restaurants on the map, including Chicken Liver Crostini with Marsala-Braised Onions; Fusili with Red Wine–Braised Octopus and Bone Marrow; and Veal Chops with Roasted Endive and Pancetta Cream Sauce. Both the Classico and Moderno sections offer ideas for your whole meal: first courses (Vitello Tonnato, Garganelli with Caviar Cream ), soups (Zuppa di Baccalá, White Bean Soup with Sautéed Shrimp), pastas (Tortellini alla Panna, Ricotta and Swiss Chard Tortelli), main courses (Pollo alla Diavola, Braised Lamb Shanks with Farrotto), and desserts (Crostata di Ricotta, Panna Cotta with Meyer Lemon–Basil Sorbet and Almond Milk Froth), as well as salads, pizzas, and basic formulas for pesto, stocks, and vinaigrettes. Including personal notes and anecdotes about White’s early sojourn in Italy and his flavorful career, Classico e Moderno will give you all the tools, tips, and tricks you need to cook tantalizing Italian dishes with the confidence of a seasoned chef. Praise for Michael White and Classico e Moderno “A masterpiece of culinary acumen and perfection in presentation . . . White once again sublimely deals with his cuisine of choice—Italian. In an attempt to bridge the gap between classic and modern, this chef extraordinaire offers the reader an experience in beauty and taste. . . . This book is a testament to both the importance/influence of Italian cuisine and to the rich and varied experiences its ingredients and tradition still have to offer.”—Publishers Weekly (starred review) “Exceedingly appealing . . . [Michael White] is one of the great chefs of modern Italian food in this country, and in Classico e Moderno he teaches us enough so that we can try to follow in his footsteps.”—Vogue “Hugely ambitious . . . White is one of a number of rising chefs here who aren’t Italian but have felt the freedom to refresh the concept of Italian food.”—Associated Press “The future of Italian gastronomy, thanks to the spectacular inventiveness he brings to modernizing the world’s most popular cuisine.”—Gotham “I’ve watched and tasted as Michael White has matured into his current position as one of the preeminent stewards and pioneers of Italian culinary tradition in America. Even his signature modern dishes are as relatable as the classics—and are perhaps even destined to be deemed classics in their own right some day.”—Thomas Keller, from the Foreword “Michael White has, in very short order, grabbed the Italian food crown for New York City.”—Anthony Bourdain",0345545532,9780345545534,450,Cooking,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kU9wAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=kU9wAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Cooking&hl=&cd=345&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kU9wAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

"In the Kitchen, 1550-1800","Madeline Bassnett, Hillary Nunn","Food Culture, Food History before 1900",2022-11-20,"In the Kitchen insists that the preparation of food, whether imaginative, physical, or spatial, is central to a deeper understanding of early modern food cultures and practices. Devoted to the arts of cooking and medicine, early modern kitchens concentrated on producing, processing, and preserving materials necessary for nourishment and survival; yet they also fed social and economic networks and nurtured a sense of physical, spiritual, and political connection to surrounding lands and their cultures. The essays in this volume illuminate this expansive view of cooking and aspire to show how the kitchen's inner workings prove tightly, though often invisibly, interwoven with local, national, and, increasingly, global surroundings. Engaging with literary and historical methodologies, including close reading, recipe analysis, and perspectives on gender, class, race, and colonialism, we begin to develop a shared theoretical and practical language for the art of cooking that combines the physical with the intellectual, the local with the global, and the domestic with the political.",9463721649,9789463721646,0,N/A,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jJY9zwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=jJY9zwEACAAJ&dq=Cooking&hl=&cd=351&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=jJY9zwEACAAJ&dq=Cooking&hl=&source=gbs_api

Relaxed Cooking with Curtis Stone,Curtis Stone,Clarkson Potter,2010-10-20,"“For me, there are few things that are more relaxing than lingering at the table with good friends . . . But I know that for a lot of people, putting together a meal, especially for guests, is the opposite of relaxing . . . I’m here to tell you: It doesn’t have to be that way.” —from the Introduction Aussie Curtis Stone, host of TLC’s Take Home Chef, is best known for his laid-back approach to cooking. Though he’s worked as head chef in several Michelin-starred London restaurants, some of his most memorable meals are the ones he’s shared with friends at home. Now, Curtis shows you how to have as much fun in the kitchen as your guests are sure to have over a comfortable, unforgettable meal. In Relaxed Cooking with Curtis Stone, you’ll find everything from “First Thing in the Morning” bites and “Brunches to Blow Their Minds” to “Weekend Lunches” and “Something to Eat on the Sofa.” With the home cook in mind, Curtis avoids off-putting culinary lingo and hard-to-find ingredients. Instead, he picks what’s in season and just around the corner. This down-to-earth approach results in wonderfully interesting and flavorful taste combinations that are perfect for parties or just hanging out with a close friend or loved ones. Recipes include: • Caramelized Nectarines with Yogurt and Honey • Crispy Tortilla with Ham, Chile, Spinach, and Fried Eggs • Heirloom Tomato and Burrata Salad with Pepper-Crusted New York Steak • Pan-Fried Calamari with Roasted Asparagus Salad • Homemade Salted Caramel Popcorn • Baby Baked Potatoes with Sour Cream and Chives • Sticky Chicken Drumsticks • Red Curry with Lobster and Pineapple • Veal Cutlet Coated in an Aged Jack Cheese Crust • Slowly Cooked Brisket with a BBQ Bourbon Sauce • Creamy Mascarpone and Parsley Polenta • Brownie Cupcakes These delicious recipes and Curtis’s infectiously easygoing attitude are all it takes to end your entertaining stress and get you and your guests into a relaxing mood.",0307885631,9780307885630,272,Cooking,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cBRhiIBFvPAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=cBRhiIBFvPAC&dq=Cooking&hl=&cd=361&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cBRhiIBFvPAC&source=gbs_api

Cooking with Joan Roca at low temperatures,Joan Roca,Planeta Gastro,2018-09-25,"The new cooking trend in domestic cuisine has arrived, endorsed by the best chef in the world. This book will show what we have learnt in the kitchen at El Celler de Can Roca, and also in our respective homes, as low-temperature cooking is a traditional technique that today, thanks to modern technology, helps us to increase the precision with which we cook. However, ultimately, cooking is all about enjoying the many bounties of gastronomy: that capacity to delight us, to look after our health, to communicate emotions, and to transmit knowledge, values and affection. By cooking we can discover our culture and that of the whole world, as well as challenge the senses, make out imagination soar, or bond a little bit more with the earth. We can also express gratitude and devote time to our loved ones.

The British Table: A New Look at the Traditional Cooking of England, Scotland, and Wales celebrates the best of British cuisine old and new.

Cooking Is Terrible,Misha Fletcher,N/A,2019-10-11,"Cooking is terrible, and food is often a massive pain in the ass. Eating is sometimes ok, sometimes a giant drag, and somehow still a thing that you have to do multiple times a day, which seems enormously unfair.This book isn't going to teach you how to cook, or turn you into the kind of person who hosts effortless dinner parties, or make you more attractive and popular and interesting. At best, it's going to make it slightly more likely that you manage to eat something in the ten minutes between walking in the door and falling into the sweet embrace of the internet. I'm not joking-a lot of this can be done, start to finish, in ten to fifteen minutes. I resent thirty-minute meals because it feels like about twenty-eight minutes too long to spend on feeding myself.If you're excited to get home from work and spend an hour cooking dinner, this isn't the book for you. If you really value authenticity, this isn't the book for you. If you literally only eat three foods and you're happy like that, this isn't the book for you.

The Gift of Southern Cooking,"Edna Lewis, Scott Peacock",Knopf,2012-06-27,"Edna Lewis—acclaimed author of the American classic, The Taste of Country Cooking—and Alabama-born chef Scott Peacock pool their unusual cooking talents to give us this unique cookbook filled with recipes and stories of two distinct styles of Southern cooking. Miss Lewis’s specialty is Virginia country cooking and Scott Peacock focuses on inventive and sensitive blending of new tastes with the Alabama foods he grew up on, liberally seasoned with Native American, Caribbean, and African influences. Together they have taken neglected traditional recipes unearthed in their years of research together on Southern food and worked out new versions that they have made their own. Together they share their secrets for such Southern basics as pan-fried chicken, creamy grits, and genuine Southern biscuits. Scott Peacock describes how Miss Lewis makes soup by coaxing the essence of flavor from vegetables, and he applies the same principle to his intensely flavored, scrumptious dish of Garlic Braised Shoulder Lamb Chops with Butter Beans and Tomatoes. You’ll find all these treasures and more before you even get to the superb cakes (potential “Cakewalk Winners” all), the hand-cranked ice creams, the flaky pies, and homey custards and puddings. Lewis and Peacock include twenty-two seasonal menus, from A Spring Country Breakfast for a Late Sunday Morning and A Summer Dinner of Big Flavors to An Alabama Thanksgiving and A Hearty Dinner for a Cold Winter Night, to show you how to mix and match dishes for a true Southern table. Interwoven throughout the book are warm memories of the people and the traditions that shaped these pure-tasting, genuinely American recipes. The result is a joyful coming together of two extraordinary cooks, sharing their gifts.

Defining Culinary Authority,Jennifer J. Davis,LSU Press,2013-01-02,"Combining rigorous archival research with social history and cultural studies, Defining Culinary Authority uncovers the lost world of France s cooks. Davis interrogates the development of cooking aesthetics and practices by examining the propagation of taste, the training of cooks, and the policing of the culinary marketplace in the name of safety and good taste. French cooks formed their profession through a series of debates intimately connected to broader Enlightenment controversies over education, cuisine, law, science, and service. Though cooks assumed prominence within the culinary public sphere, the unique literary genre of gastronomy replaced the Old Regime guild police in the wake of the French Revolution as individual diners began to question cooks authority in treatises about cooking and consuming food. This question of who wielded culinary influence and thus shaped standards of taste continued to reverberate throughout society in the early nineteenth century.",0807145343,9780807145340,265,Cooking,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mB9fDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=mB9fDwAAQBAJ&dq=Cooking&hl=&cd=396&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=mB9fDwAAQBAJ&dq=Cooking&hl=&source=gbs_api

In the Hands of A Chef,"Jody Adams, Ken Rivard",Harper Collins,2002-01-08,"How do great chefs make their food taste better? Is it the ingredients they use? Their cooking techniques and equipment? That's part of the answer. But the real secret is that truly great chefs follow their instincts -- the kitchens in their heads. Now, in her first cookbook, Jody Adams, the award-winning chef/co-owner of Boston's Rialto, teaches you how to follow your own instincts and make the transition from passionate eater to passionate cook. In the Hands of a Chef shares Jody's favorite dishes, those she prepares for family and friends in her home kitchen. By teaching the basics of artisanal cooking, or making good food from scratch, she gives cooks a solid foundation for cooking like a chef. She tells readers what to look for when buying ingredients, what equipment is essential, and how a dish should look and taste while being prepared. Above all, Jody encourages readers to trust their instincts and follow them to create a cooking style that feels right, using recipes as the building blocks for their own creations. From starters, seasonal soups, salads, and main courses to desserts, Jody reinvents Mediterranean foods using unconventional ingredients, many from New England. For a boost of summer flavor, grilled tomatoes add depth to gazpacho. To vary the flavor of simple salads -- from a Minted Romaine Salad with Grapes, Ricotta Salata, and Toasted Almonds to Arugula and Portobella Mushroom Salad-one or two seasonal ingredients are added to the usual recipes. Drawing inspiration from Italian tradition, Jody offers up innovative pasta and grains dishes. Ravioli, pappardelle, gnocchi, and linguine are served up with Mediterranean flavors and ingredients -- tomatoes, olives, figs, chestnuts, fresh greens, wild mushrooms, Parmesan cheese -- for home-style meals any time of the year. Yet much of Jody's cooking is pure American in flavor. Dessert classics are reinvented with new twists, such as Super-Creamy Rice Pudding with Passion Fruit Sauce and Heather's Cranberry Chocolate Pecan Tart. Here, too, are Jody's signature dishes, including Roasted Marinated Long Island Duck with Green Olive and Balsamic Vinegar Sauce and Soupe de Poisson, which Jacques PÉpin calls the best version outside of France. Intended to make you wish you had more time to spend in the kitchen, In the Hands of a Chef is an inspiration as well as an essential resource for every cook. Why be just a good cook when you can be a great one?

The Reluctant Vegetarian Cookbook,Sharalyn Pliler,AuthorHouse,2009-07-08,"“Who in their right minds would ever want to be a vegetarian?” Sharalyn Pliler asked just months before she—accidentally—became one. A few days into a camping trip in the woods, she was amazed to experience that instead of getting weaker without meat, just the opposite happened—she felt more energetic, lighter and more clear-headed, needing to eat less than before while enjoying food even more, as if her taste buds had come alive. Reluctant to become a vegetarian but unable to argue with definitive direct experience, she had no choice but to begin the transition from familiar meat cookery to the unknown world of vegetarianism. Not many cookbooks are page-turners but with her light-hearted style, down-home sense of humor and master’s level writing skills, readers are carried effortlessly as she tells her story of awakening to the pleasures and techniques of vegetarianism. Once a cook in a vegetarian university kitchen, now with three decades of vegetarian experience, she seems to anticipate every question.",1438985207,9781438985206,254,Cooking,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KRWDKKvCqIwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=KRWDKKvCqIwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Cooking&hl=&cd=435&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KRWDKKvCqIwC&source=gbs_api

The Kitchen Whisperers,Dorothy Kalins,William Morrow,2021-09-07,"A beautifully written tribute to the people who teach us to cook and guide our hands in the kitchen, by the founding editor of Saveur. The cooking lessons that stick with us are rarely the ones we read in books or learn through blog posts or YouTube videos (depending on your generation); they're the ones we pick up as we spend time with good cooks in the kitchen. Dorothy Kalins, founding editor of Savuer magazine, calls the people who pass on their cooking wisdom her Kitchen Whisperers. Consciously or not, they help make us the cooks we are--and help show the way to the kind of cooks we have the potential to become. Dorothy's prolific career in food media means many of her Kitchen Whisperers are some of the best chefs around (though the lessons she's learned from fellow home cooks are just as important). For Dorothy, a lifetime of exposure to incredible cooks and chefs means that she can't enter her kitchen without hearing the voices of mentors and friends with whom she cooked over the years as they reveal their favorite techniques. Marcella Hazan warns her against valuing look over flavor. Christopher Hirsheimer advises that sometimes water is the best liquid to add to a dish rather than stock or wine. Her onetime Southern mother-in-law wisely knows that not everyone who asks for a biscuit is food hungry. Woven through the text are dozens of narrative recipes, from her mother's meat loaf to David Tanis's Swiss Chard Gratin. The Kitchen Whisperers will prompt older readers to identify and cherish the food mentors in their own lives, just as it will inspire younger readers to seek them out. Stories and recipes from Dorothy's notable connections will inspire the creative food journeys of all.",0063001640,9780063001640,320,N/A,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=K6gbzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=K6gbzgEACAAJ&dq=Cooking&hl=&cd=438&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=K6gbzgEACAAJ&dq=Cooking&hl=&source=gbs_api

The Taste of Art,"Silvia Bottinelli, Margherita d’Ayala Valva",University of Arkansas Press,2017-06-01,"The Taste of Art offers a sample of scholarly essays that examine the role of food in Western contemporary art practices. The contributors are scholars from a range of disciplines, including art history, philosophy, film studies, and history. As a whole, the volume illustrates how artists engage with food as matter and process in order to explore alternative aesthetic strategies and indicate countercultural shifts in society. The collection opens by exploring the theoretical intersections of art and food, food art’s historical root in Futurism, and the ways in which food carries gendered meaning in popular film. Subsequent sections analyze the ways in which artists challenge mainstream ideas through food in a variety of scenarios. Beginning from a focus on the body and subjectivity, the authors zoom out to look at the domestic sphere, and finally the public sphere. Here are essays that study a range of artists including, among others, Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Daniel Spoerri, Dieter Roth, Joseph Beuys, Al Ruppersberg, Alison Knowles, Martha Rosler, Robin Weltsch, Vicki Hodgetts, Paul McCarthy, Luciano Fabro, Carries Mae Weems, Peter Fischli and David Weiss, Janine Antoni, Elżbieta Jabłońska, Liza Lou, Tom Marioni, Rirkrit Tiravanija, Michael Rakowitz, and Natalie Jeremijenko.",1682260259,9781682260258,417,Art,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GP6dDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=GP6dDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Cooking&hl=&cd=445&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=GP6dDgAAQBAJ&dq=Cooking&hl=&source=gbs_api

From Microliths to Microwaves,Colin Spencer,Grub Street Cookery,2011,"This important book is a ground breaking work on the subject of British food. It had been thought that civilization in Britain, which stems from farming, food and cookery all began with the Romans. But it has now been discovered that thriving communities possessing a long history with their own ritual, laws, culture and food, inhabited Britain long before that time. Food is the fundamental spur to action, innovation, exploration and creativity in humankind. This book explores the roots of our national existence through the cultivation of its land, the production and cooking of its food, revealing the molding force of climate and the constant invention in technology that produced the food through the centuries. It will end in the present but will also consider the ominous, immediate future with the combined threat of global warming and Peak Oil. It is a breath-taking attempt to trace the changes to and influences on food in Britain from the earliest dawning of time when England became an island, through the Roman occupation, the Plague years, the Industrial Revolution, the rise of Capitalism to the present day. There has been a recent wave of interest in food culture and history and Colin Spencer's masterful, readable account of our culinary history is a celebrated contribution to the genre. There has never been such an exciting, broad-scoped history of the food of these islands. It should remind us all of our rich past and the gastronomic importance of British cuisine.",1908117001,9781908117007,0,Agriculture,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1i7ztgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=1i7ztgAACAAJ&dq=Cooking&hl=&cd=448&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=1i7ztgAACAAJ&dq=Cooking&hl=&source=gbs_api

Mastering the Art of Soviet Cooking,Anya von Bremzen,Crown,2014-09-16,"A James Beard Award-winning writer captures life under the Red socialist banner in this wildly inventive, tragicomic memoir of feasts, famines, and three generations “Delicious . . . A banquet of anecdote that brings history to life with intimacy, candor, and glorious color.”—NPR’s All Things Considered Born in 1963, in an era of bread shortages, Anya grew up in a communal Moscow apartment where eighteen families shared one kitchen. She sang odes to Lenin, black-marketeered Juicy Fruit gum at school, watched her father brew moonshine, and, like most Soviet citizens, longed for a taste of the mythical West. It was a life by turns absurd, naively joyous, and melancholy—and ultimately intolerable to her anti-Soviet mother, Larisa. When Anya was ten, she and Larisa fled the political repression of Brezhnev-era Russia, arriving in Philadelphia with no winter coats and no right of return. Now Anya occupies two parallel food universes: one where she writes about four-star restaurants, the other where a taste of humble kolbasa transports her back to her scarlet-blazed socialist past. To bring that past to life, Anya and her mother decide to eat and cook their way through every decade of the Soviet experience. Through these meals, and through the tales of three generations of her family, Anya tells the intimate yet epic story of life in the USSR. Wildly inventive and slyly witty, Mastering the Art of Soviet Cooking is that rare book that stirs our souls and our senses.

COOKING FOR PROFIT PART XI TEA ROOM MANAGEMENT SELECTING THE LOCATION AND NAME; DECORATIONS, FUR- NISHINGS, EQUIPMENT AND PLANS; SOME THINGS TO AVOID; TYPICAL MENUS FOR TOWN AND COUNTRY TEA ROOMS; TEA ROOM SPECIALTIES; SUGGESTIONS AND RECIPES FOR BEVERAGES, SANDWICHES, SALADS, HOT DISHES AND DESSERTS; COSTS, PRIC- ING AND PROFITS. INTEREST in opening tea rooms is wide spread, from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Some people apparently think that little is required save an attractively furnished room and a teapot or two, but we advise anybody to consider carefully, before investing the amount of money that must be spent, if even the simplest tea room is to be opened. When you have started such a business, in order to be profitable, it may need to be developed along any of the avenues suggested in previous lessons and every bit of knowledge, information and experience that you have gathered will be no more than you can use, no matter how simply you begin. The serving of afternoon tea, only, does not often prove a profitable undertaking. In connection with a tea room it is wise to conduct a gift shop or a cake shop, to sell homemade candy or preserves, operate a soda fountain, put up box lunches for motorists, to serve lunches and suppers or cater for dinner parties. Many a tea house has become a little motor inn, serving dainty yet satisfying meals, and with cool attractive bedrooms, and immaculate bathrooms for guests who spend the night, and dressing-rooms for others. From replies to many questionnaires sent out to the managers of successful tea rooms we list the following: Requisites For A Successful Tea Room Good location Unusual or expressive name Distinctive decorations and furnishings Absolute cleanliness Competent hostess or manager...",1230199993,9781230199993,82,N/A,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=d1iingEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=d1iingEACAAJ&dq=Cooking&hl=&cd=461&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=d1iingEACAAJ&dq=Cooking&hl=&source=gbs_api

Bistro Cooking at Home,"Gordon Hamersley, Joanne McAllister Smart",Broadway,2003,"Bistro cooking—bold and full-flavored—is more like the best home cooking than restaurant fare, featuring slow-cooked stews, exquisitely roasted chickens, perfectly seared steaks, vibrant salads, fresh fruit tarts, and comforting custards. Now Gordon Hamersley of acclaimed Hamersley’s Bistro in Boston helps home cooks bring these classic dishes into their own kitchens. Bistro Cooking at Home offers a complete menu of versatile selections for cooks who crave sophisticated but easy-to-prepare comfort food. Many of the dishes allow for “walk-away cooking,” such as stews, roasts, or braises. And many of these same dishes taste best if prepared a day or two ahead, making entertaining foolproof. Although the accent is French, dishes such as hamburgers stuffed with blue cheese and Pear Cranberry Crumble reflect Gordon Hamersley’s all-American roots. Start a bistro meal at home with Hamersley’s classic Onion Soup au Gratin or signature Wild Mushroom and Roasted Garlic Sandwich. For a main course there is roast chicken (you can cook it ahead and reheat it under the broiler), New England Bouillabaisse with Rouille and Croutons, or Moroccan lamb shanks. Pasta, polenta, and risotto are given French finesse in dishes such as Lemon-Scented Risotto with Morels and Chives and Oven-Baked Penne with Onions, Walnuts, and Goat Cheese. The Savory Tarts, Gratins, and Galettes chapter holds such richly satisfying dishes as Portobello Mushroom and Roquefort Galette or Creamy Bistro Potato and Leek Gratin, each practically a meal in itself. Even vegetables are made exciting in dishes ranging from Roasted Artichokes with Garlic and Pancetta Bread Crumbs to Garlicky Mashed Potato Cakes. Bistro-inspired desserts include Maple Crème Brûlée, Profiteroles with Easy Chocolate Sauce, and a dense Chocolate Truffle Cake. All the main dishes are accompanied by knowledgeable, down-to-earth wine recommendations from Fiona Hamersley, Gordon’s wife, who runs the wine service at the restaurant. With the Hamersleys’s expert guidance every step of the way, you can re-create the romance of bistro dining—at home.",0767912764,9780767912761,0,"Cookery, American",en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=M-VgNQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=M-VgNQAACAAJ&dq=Cooking&hl=&cd=466&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=M-VgNQAACAAJ&dq=Cooking&hl=&source=gbs_api

"Cooking, Cuisine, and Class",Jack Goody,N/A,1982,"The preparation, serving and eating of food are common features of all human societies, and have been the focus of study for numerous anthropologists - from Sir James Frazer onwards - from a variety of theoretical and empirical perspectives. It is in the context of this previous anthropological work that Jack Goody sets his own observations on cooking in West Africa. He criticises those approaches which overlook the comparative historical dimension of culinary, and other, cultural differences that emerge in class societies, both of which elements he particularly emphasises in this book. The central question that Professor Goody addresses here is why a differentiated 'haute cuisine' has not emerged in Africa, as it has in other parts of the world. His account of cooking in West Africa is followed by a survey of the culinary practices of the major Eurasian societies throughout history - ranging from Ancient Egypt, Imperial Rome and medieval China to early modern Europe - in which he relates the differences in food preparation and consumption emerging in these societies to differences in their socio-economic structures, specifically in modes of production and communication. He concludes with an examination of the world-wide rise of 'industrial food' and its impact on Third World societies, showing that the ability of the latter to resist cultural domination in food, as in other things, is related to the nature of their pre-existing socio-economic structures. The arguments presented here will interest all social scientists and historians concerned with cultural history and social theory.",0521244552,9780521244558,253,Social Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bGpfQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=bGpfQgAACAAJ&dq=Cooking&hl=&cd=469&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=bGpfQgAACAAJ&dq=Cooking&hl=&source=gbs_api
Share,Errieda du Toit,Penguin Random House South Africa,2019-10-01,"Champion of South African home cooking, Errieda du Toit set out to write a cookbook about the food we most love to eat and the culture of sharing these recipe in community cookbooks. Intrigued by our strong attachment to these dog-eared, food-stained recipe collections, she pored over 150 titles spanning a century. SHARE is her tribute to this humble culinary source and a celebration of its collaborative spirit. It’s the first book to deal specifically with the genre, exploring our intimate relationship with these unassuming little books and their role in shaping food culture. The result is a delightful, quirky and thoroughly modern homage to the genre, tapping into our food memories in a unique way. SHARE features a wide selection of recipes as generous, gracious and welcoming as the home cooks who shared them. They’re all here: the keepers (recipes known for their longevity); the never-fails (those epic recipes that never let you down); communal food for come-on-overs; as well as retro classics alongside those defining dishes and bakes treasured as heritage food. Bringing visual expression to Errieda’s vision of bringing community cookbooks out of the dark corner of food literature, SHARE is beautifully photographed by Errieda’s husband Ian du Toit. The witty styling by Hannes Koegelenberg and creative book design by Marcus Viljoen further capture the character and off-beat traits of the genre. With the right blend of nostalgia, modern revival of old-school recipes and captivating story-telling, SHARE is for home cooks, cookbook collectors and anyone curious and enthusiastic about South African food.",1432310011,9781432310011,352,Cooking,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XO6yDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=XO6yDwAAQBAJ&dq=Cooking&hl=&cd=470&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=XO6yDwAAQBAJ&dq=Cooking&hl=&source=gbs_api
