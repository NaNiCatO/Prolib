Kinetic Modelling in Systems Biology,"Oleg Demin, Igor Goryanin",CRC Press,2008-10-24,"With more and more interest in how components of biological systems interact, it is important to understand the various aspects of systems biology. Kinetic Modelling in Systems Biology focuses on one of the main pillars in the future development of systems biology. It explores both the methods and applications of kinetic modeling in this emerging field. The book introduces the basic biological cellular network concepts in the context of cellular functioning, explains the main aspects of the Edinburgh Pathway Editor (EPE) software package, and discusses the process of constructing and verifying kinetic models. It presents the features, user interface, and examples of DBSolve as well as the principles of modeling individual enzymes and transporters. The authors describe how to construct kinetic models of intracellular systems on the basis of models of individual enzymes. They also illustrate how to apply the principles of kinetic modeling to collect all available information on the energy metabolism of whole organelles, construct a kinetic model, and predict the response of the organelle to changes in external conditions. The final chapter focuses on applications of kinetic modeling in biotechnology and biomedicine. Encouraging readers to think about future challenges, this book will help them understand the kinetic modeling approach and how to apply it to solve real-life problems. Downloadable Resources FeaturesExtensively used throughout the text for pathway visualization and illustration, the EPE software is available on the accompanying downloadable resources. The downloadable resources also include pathway diagrams in several graphical formats, DBSolve installation with examples, and all models from the book with dynamic visualization of simulation results, allowing readers to perform in silico simulations and use the models as templates for further applications.",1420011669,9781420011661,356,Mathematics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rf0t-uF7L0QC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=rf0t-uF7L0QC&pg=PR19&dq=Biology&hl=&cd=8&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rf0t-uF7L0QC&source=gbs_api

Urban Evolutionary Biology,"Marta Szulkin, Jason Munshi-South, Anne Charmantier",N/A,2020,"Cities occupy about 3 per cent of the Earth's habitable land area and are home to one out of two humans worldwide; both estimates are predicted to grow. Urban space is thus becoming an important, novel ecological niche for humans and wildlife alike. Building on knowledge gathered by urban ecologists during the last half century, evidence of evolutionary responses to urbanization has rapidly emerged. Urban evolutionary biology is a nascent yet fast-growing field of research--and a fascinating testing ground for evolutionary biologists worldwide. Urbanization offers a great range of opportunities to examine evolutionary processes because of the radically altered and easily quantifiable urban habitat, and the large number of cities worldwide, enabling rigorous, replicated tests of evolutionary hypotheses. Urban populations are increasingly exhibiting both neutral and adaptive evolutionary changes at levels ranging from genotypes to phenotypes. The novelty of urban evolutionary biology is that these changes are driven by the cities we have built, including effects of infrastructure, pollution, and social characteristics of our urban neighbourhoods. It will thereby enrich the field of evolutionary biology with emergent yet incredibly potent new research themes where the urban habitat is key. In a series of sixteen chapters written by leading evolutionary biologists working on urban drivers of evolution, Urban Evolutionary Biology is the first academic book in the field. It synthesizes current knowledge on evolutionary processes occurring literally on our doorstep, across the globe, and in each city independently.--Provided by publisher.",0198836848,9780198836841,318,Nature,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YwfcDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=YwfcDwAAQBAJ&pg=PR14&dq=Biology&hl=&cd=25&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=YwfcDwAAQBAJ&dq=Biology&hl=&source=gbs_api
The Biology of Urban Environments,Philip James,Oxford University Press,2018-06-28,"How do plants, animals, and humans manage to survive and adapt to the urban environment? This book provides a comprehensive coverage of biological matters related to urban environments presenting both the conceptual and theoretical underpinnings, and practical examples required to understand and address the challenges presented by this novel environment. The Biology of Urban Environments focusses on urban denizens: species (both domesticated and non-domesticated) that live for all or part of their life cycle in towns and cities. The biology of household plants and companion animals is discussed alongside that of species that have become feral or have not been domesticated.

Mathematical Methods in Biology,"J. David Logan, William Wolesensky",John Wiley & Sons,2009-08-17,"A one-of-a-kind guide to using deterministic and probabilistic methods for solving problems in the biological sciences Highlighting the growing relevance of quantitative techniques in scientific research, Mathematical Methods in Biology provides an accessible presentation of the broad range of important mathematical methods for solving problems in the biological sciences. The book reveals the growing connections between mathematics and biology through clear explanations and specific, interesting problems from areas such as population dynamics, foraging theory, and life history theory. The authors begin with an introduction and review of mathematical tools that are employed in subsequent chapters, including biological modeling, calculus, differential equations, dimensionless variables, and descriptive statistics. The following chapters examine standard discrete and continuous models using matrix algebra as well as difference and differential equations. Finally, the book outlines probability, statistics, and stochastic methods as well as material on bootstrapping and stochastic differential equations, which is a unique approach that is not offered in other literature on the topic. In order to demonstrate the application of mathematical methods to the biological sciences, the authors provide focused examples from the field of theoretical ecology, which serve as an accessible context for study while also demonstrating mathematical skills that are applicable to many other areas in the life sciences. The book's algorithms are illustrated using MATLAB®, but can also be replicated using other software packages, including R, Mathematica®, and Maple; however, the text does not require any single computer algebra package. Each chapter contains numerous exercises and problems that range in difficulty, from the basic to more challenging, to assist readers with building their problem-solving skills. Selected solutions are included at the back of the book, and a related Web site features supplemental material for further study. Extensively class-tested to ensure an easy-to-follow format, Mathematical Methods in Biology is an excellent book for mathematics and biology courses at the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels. It also serves as a valuable reference for researchers and professionals working in the fields of biology, ecology, and biomathematics.",0470525878,9780470525876,437,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6GGyquH8kLcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=6GGyquH8kLcC&pg=PA53&dq=Biology&hl=&cd=28&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=6GGyquH8kLcC&dq=Biology&hl=&source=gbs_api

What Makes Biology Unique?,Ernst Mayr,Cambridge University Press,2007-04-16,"This book, a collection of essays written by the most eminent evolutionary biologist of the twentieth century, explores biology as an autonomous science, offers insights on the history of evolutionary thought, critiques the contributions of philosophy to the science of biology, and comments on several of the major ongoing issues in evolutionary theory. Notably, Mayr explains that Darwin's theory of evolution is actually five separate theories, each with its own history, trajectory and impact. Natural selection is a separate idea from common descent, and from geographic speciation, and so on. A number of the perennial Darwinian controversies may well have been caused by the confounding of the five separate theories into a single composite.

Biology and Biotechnology of the Plant Hormone Ethylene II,A.K. Kanellis,Springer Science & Business Media,1999-09-30,"The inflorescence of the monoecious maize plant is unique among the Gramineae in the sharp separation of the male and female structures. The male tassel at the terminus of the plant most often sheds pollen before the visual appearance of the receptive silks of th the female ear at a lateral bud, normally at the 10 leaf [I]. Earlier studies examined the ontogeny of the growing tissues beginning with the embryo in the kernel through to the obvious protuberances of the growing point as the kernel germinates. The differentiated developing soon-to-become tassel and the lateral bulges that develop into the ears on the lateral buds become apparent very early in the germinating kernel [2, 3, 46]. A certain number of cells are destined for tassel and ear development [8]. As the plant develops, there is a phase transition [\3, 16] from the vegetative lateral buds to the reproductive lateral buds. This change in phase has been ascribed to genotypic control as evidenced in the differences among different genotypes in the initiation of the reproductive [I]. The genetic control of tassel and ear initiation has been gleaned from anatomical observations. Lejeune and Bernier [I2] found that maize plants terminate the initiation of additional axillary meristems at the time of tassel initiation. This would indicate that the top-most ear shoot is initiated on the same day as the initiation of tassel development and this event signals the end of the undifferentiated growing point.",0792359410,9780792359418,486,Nature,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8A9U9k4ag7kC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=8A9U9k4ag7kC&pg=PA20&dq=Biology&hl=&cd=37&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=8A9U9k4ag7kC&dq=Biology&hl=&source=gbs_api

The Black Box of Biology,Michel Morange,Harvard University Press,2020-06-09,"In this masterful account, a historian of science surveys the molecular biology revolution, its origin and continuing impact. Since the 1930s, a molecular vision has been transforming biology. Michel Morange provides an incisive and overarching history of this transformation, from the early attempts to explain organisms by the structure of their chemical components, to the birth and consolidation of genetics, to the latest technologies and discoveries enabled by the new science of life. Morange revisits A History of Molecular Biology and offers new insights from the past twenty years into his analysis. The Black Box of Biology shows that what led to the incredible transformation of biology was not a simple accumulation of new results, but the molecularization of a large part of biology. In fact, Morange argues, the greatest biological achievements of the past few decades should still be understood within the molecular paradigm. What has happened is not the displacement of molecular biology by other techniques and avenues of research, but rather the fusion of molecular principles and concepts with those of other disciplines, including genetics, physics, structural chemistry, and computational biology. This has produced decisive changes, including the discoveries of regulatory RNAs, the development of massive scientific programs such as human genome sequencing, and the emergence of synthetic biology, systems biology, and epigenetics.

"Mathematics, Developmental Biology and Tumour Growth","Fernando Giráldez, Miguel Ángel Herrero",American Mathematical Soc.,2009,"Developmental biology and tumour growth are two important areas of current research where mathematics increasingly provides powerful new techniques and insights. The unfolding complexity of living structures from egg to embryo gives rise to a number of difficult quantitative problems that are ripe for mathematical models and analysis. Understanding this early development process involves the study of pattern formation, which mathematicians view through the lens of dynamical systems. This book addresses several issues in developmental biology, including Notch signalling pathway integration and mesenchymal compartment formation. Tumour growth is one of the primary challenges of cancer research. Its study requires interdisciplinary approaches involving the close collaboration of mathematicians, biologists and physicians. The summer school addressed angiogenesis, modelling issues arising in radiotherapy, and tumour growth viewed from the individual cell and the relation to a multiphase-fluid flow picture of that process. This book is suitable for researchers, graduate students, and advanced undergraduates interested in mathematical methods of developmental biology or tumour growth.",0821846639,9780821846636,137,Mathematics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BtAbCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=BtAbCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA2&dq=Biology&hl=&cd=48&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BtAbCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api
"Evolution, the Logic of Biology","John S. Torday, Virender K. Rehan",John Wiley & Sons,2017-08-07,"By focusing on the cellular mechanisms that underlie ontogeny, phylogeny and regeneration of complex physiologic traits, Evolution, the Logic of Biology demonstrates the use of homeostasis, the fundamental principle of physiology and medicine, as the unifying mechanism for evolution as all of biology. The homeostasis principle can be used to understand how environmental stressors have affected physiologic mechanisms to generate condition-specific novelty through cellular mechanisms. Evolution, the Logic of Biology allows the reader to understand the vertebrate life-cycle as an intergenerational continuum in support of effective, on-going environmental adaptation. By understanding the principles of physiology from their fundamental unicellular origins, culminating in modern-day metazoans, the reader as student, researcher or practitioner will be encouraged to think in terms of the prevention of disease, rather than in the treatment of disease as the eradication of symptoms. By tracing the ontogeny and phylogeny of this and other phenotypic homologies, one can perceive and understand how complex physiologic traits have mechanistically evolved from their simpler ancestral and developmental origins as cellular structures and functions, providing a logic of biology for the first time. Evolution, the Logic of Biology will be an invaluable resource for graduate students and researchers studying evolutionary development, medicine and biology, anthropology, comparative and developmental biology, genetics and genomics, and physiology.",1118729269,9781118729267,304,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_llZDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=_llZDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA103&dq=Biology&hl=&cd=49&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=_llZDwAAQBAJ&dq=Biology&hl=&source=gbs_api

Emerging Threats of Synthetic Biology and Biotechnology,"Benjamin D. Trump, Marie-Valentine Florin, Edward Perkins, Igor Linkov",Springer Nature,2021,"Synthetic biology is a field of biotechnology that is rapidly growing in various applications, such as in medicine, environmental sustainability, and energy production. However these technologies also have unforeseen risks and applications to humans and the environment. This open access book presents discussions on risks and mitigation strategies for these technologies including biosecurity, or the potential of synthetic biology technologies and processes to be deliberately misused for nefarious purposes. The book presents strategies to prevent, mitigate, and recover from 'dual-use concern' biosecurity challenges that may be raised by individuals, rogue states, or non-state actors. Several key topics are explored including opportunities to develop more coherent and scalable approaches to govern biosecurity from a laboratory perspective up to the international scale and strategies to prevent potential health and environmental hazards posed by deliberate misuse of synthetic biology without stifling innovation. The book brings together the expertise of top scholars in synthetic biology and biotechnology risk assessment, management, and communication to discuss potential biosecurity governing strategies and offer perspectives for collaboration in oversight and future regulatory guidance.",940242086X,9789402420869,233,Biomedical engineering,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jt5BEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=jt5BEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA86&dq=Biology&hl=&cd=52&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=jt5BEAAAQBAJ&dq=Biology&hl=&source=gbs_api

Ultimately, synthetic biologists hope to design and build engineered biological systems with capabilities that do not exist in natural systems -- capabilities that may ultimately be used for applications in manufacturing, food production, and global health. Importantly, synthetic biology represents an area of science and engineering that raises technical, ethical, regulatory, security, biosafety, intellectual property, and other issues that will be resolved differently in different parts of the world. As a better understanding of the global synthetic biology landscape could lead to tremendous benefits, six academies -- the United Kingdom's Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering, the United States' National Academy of Sciences and National Academy of Engineering, and the Chinese Academy of Science and Chinese Academy of Engineering -- organized a series of international symposia on the scientific, technical, and policy issues associated with synthetic biology.

Molecular Biology and Biotechnology of Plant Organelles,"Henry Daniell, Ph.D., Christine D. Chase",Springer Science & Business Media,2007-11-04,"We have taught plant molecular biology and biotechnology at the undergraduate and graduate level for over 20 years. In the past few decades, the field of plant organelle molecular biology and biotechnology has made immense strides. From the green revolution to golden rice, plant organelles have revolutionized agriculture. Given the exponential growth in research, the problem of finding appropriate textbooks for courses in plant biotechnology and molecular biology has become a major challenge. After years of handing out photocopies of various journal articles and reviews scattered through out the print and electronic media, a serendipitous meeting occurred at the 2002 IATPC World Congress held in Orlando, Florida. After my talk and evaluating several posters presented by investigators from my laboratory, Dr. Jacco Flipsen, Publishing Manager of Kluwer Publishers asked me whether I would consider editing a book on Plant Organelles. I accepted this challenge, after months of deliberations, primarily because I was unsuccessful in finding a text book in this area for many years. I signed the contract with Kluwer in March 2003 with a promise to deliver a camera-ready textbook on July 1, 2004. Given the short deadline and the complexity of the task, I quickly realized this task would need a co-editor.

The Molecular Biology of Cancer,"Stella Pelengaris, Michael Khan",John Wiley & Sons,2013-03-13,"The Molecular Biology of Cancer, Stella Pelengaris & Michael Khan This capturing, comprehensive text, extensively revised and updated for its second edition, provides a detailed overview of the molecular mechanisms underpinning the development of cancer and its treatment. “Bench to Bedside”: A key strength of this book that sets it apart from general cancer biology references is the interweaving of all aspects of cancer biology from the causes, development and diagnosis through to the treatment and care of cancer patients – essential for providing a broader view of cancer and its impact. The highly readable presentation of a complex field, written by an international panel of researchers, specialists and practitioners, would provide an excellent text for graduate and undergraduate courses in the biology of cancer, medical students and qualified practitioners in the field preparing for higher exams, and for researchers and teachers in the field. For the teaching of cancer biology, special features have been included to facilitate this use: bullet points at the beginning of each chapter explaining key concepts and controversial areas; each chapter builds on concepts learned in previous chapters, with a list of key outstanding questions remaining in the field, suggestions for further reading, and questions for student review. All chapters contain text boxes that provide additional and relevant information. Key highlights are listed below: An overview of the cancer cell and important new concepts. Selected human cancers: lung, breast, colorectal, prostate, renal, skin, cervix, and hematological malignancies. Key cellular processes in cancer biology including (a) traditionally important areas such as cell cycle control, growth regulation, oncogenes and tumour suppressors apoptosis, as well as (b) more highly topical areas of apoptosis, telomeres, DNA damage and repair, cell adhesion, angiogenesis, immunity, epigenetics, and the proteasome. Clinical oncology: In-depth coverage of important concepts such as screening, risk of cancer and prevention, diagnoses, managing cancer patients from start to palliative care and end-of-life pathways. Chapters highlighting the direct links between cancer research and clinical applications. New coverage on how cancer drugs are actually used in specific cancer patients, and how therapies are developed and tested. Systems Biology and cutting edge research areas covered such as RNA interference (RNAi). Each chapter includes key points, chapter summaries, text boxes, and topical references for added comprehension and review. Quotations have been used in each chapter to introduce basic concepts in an entertaining way. Supported by a dedicated website at www.blackwellpublishing.com/pelengaris We should list the great reviews we got for first edition which are on the back of the 2nd edition: “A capturing, comprehensive, clearly written and absolutely accurate introduction into cancer biology.....This book deserves great praise for the readable presentation of this complex field....the true synthesis of bench and bedside approaches is marvelously achieved.” Christian Schmidt, Molecular Cell “Chapters address the issues of cancer diagnosis, treatment, and patient care and set the book apart from general molecular biology references....This book is applicable to both graduate and undergraduate students, and in the context of a research laboratory, this book would be an excellent resource as a reference guide for scientists at all levels.” V.Emuss, Institute of Cancer Research, London. Also, from the first edition: “Pelengaris, Khan, and the contributing authors are to be applauded. The Molecular Biology of Cancer is a comprehensive and readable presentation of the many faces of cancer from molecular mechanisms to clinical therapies and diagnostics.

Biology and Epistemology,"Richard Creath, Jane Maienschein",Cambridge University Press,2000,"First published in 2000, this set of essays by some of the best names in philosophy of science explores a range of diverse issues in the intersection of biology and epistemology. It asks whether the study of life requires a special biological approach to knowledge and concludes that it does not. The studies, taken together, help to develop and deepen our understanding of how biology works and what counts as warranted knowledge and as legitimate approaches to the study of life.

The Biology of Belief,Bruce H. Lipton,ReadHowYouWant.com,2010-03,"Author Lipton is a former medical school professor and research scientist. His experiments, and those of other leading-edge scientists, have examined in great detail the processes by which cells receive information. The implications of this research radically change our understanding of life. It shows that genes and DNA do not control our biology; that instead DNA is controlled by signals from outside the cell, including the energetic messages emanating from our positive and negative thoughts. Dr. Lipton's profoundly hopeful synthesis of the latest and best research in cell biology and quantum physics is being hailed as a breakthrough, showing that our bodies can be changed as we retrain our thinking.",145877032X,9781458770325,358,Psychology,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=p6Pgi7b_ZCsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,3,1,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=p6Pgi7b_ZCsC&pg=PR1&dq=Biology&hl=&cd=77&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=p6Pgi7b_ZCsC&dq=Biology&hl=&source=gbs_api

Biology of the Grapevine,"Michael G. Mullins, Alain Bouquet, Larry E. Williams",Cambridge University Press,1992-07-16,"Information on the evolution, taxonomy, morphology, anatomy, physiology and genetics of grapevines has been scarce and thinly spread in the literature on horticulture and the plant sciences. This book aims to provide a concise but comprehensive overview of the biology and cultivation of the grapevine, accessible to all concerned with viticulture. After a description of the essential features of viticulture, including a concise history from antiquity to modern times, the taxonomy of the grapevine and the evolutionary processes which gave rise to the diversity within the Vitaceae is considered. Particular attention is paid to the genera Vitis and Muscadinia, which are considered a reserve of genetic variation for the improvement of grapevines. A description of the vegetative and reproductive anatomy of the grapevine precedes a full discussion of the developmental and environmental physiology of these fascinating and economically important plants. The concluding chapter considers the potential for genetic improvement of grapevines and includes coverage of the problems encountered, and the methods and strategies employed in breeding for scions and rootstocks.",0521305071,9780521305075,256,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wnNvmRjfxgQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,4,2,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=wnNvmRjfxgQC&pg=PP11&dq=Biology&hl=&cd=79&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=wnNvmRjfxgQC&dq=Biology&hl=&source=gbs_api

Biology and Mathematics,Roger Buis,John Wiley & Sons,2019-12-12,"To formalize the dynamics of living things is to search for invariants in a system that contains an irreducible aspect of “fuzziness”, because biological processes are characterized by their large statistical variability, and strong dependence on temporal and environmental factors. What is essential is the identification of what remains stable in a “living being” that is highly fluctuating. The use of mathematics is not limited to the use of calculating tools to simulate and predict results. It also allows us to adopt a way of thinking that is founded on concepts and hypotheses, leading to their discussion and validation. Instruments of mathematical intelligibility and coherence have gradually “fashioned” the view we now have of biological systems.

Evolutionary Developmental Biology of Crustacea,Gerhard Scholtz,CRC Press,2003-06-01,"Crustaceans, due to the great diversity of their body organization, segmentation patterns, tagmatization, limb types, larval forms, cleavage, and gastrulation modes, are highly desirable for the study of questions at the interface of evolution and development. Modern interest in evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo) rests on the molecular genetic approach and a variety of molecular techniques have proven fruitful when performed on crustaceans. Evolutionary Developmental Biology of Crustacea presents a comprehensive treatment of all aspects of the field, beginning with a discussion of the implications of the typological Bauplan and phylum concepts versus historical concepts such as ground pattern and monophylum for the formulation of conceptual questions in evo-devo. Following this, the authors present the results of Hox gene expression in various crustacean taxa, aspects of segment formation at the cellular and genetic levels, the formation of segmental structures such as neurons, ganglia, and limbs, and the role of morphological ontogenetic characters in resolving phylogenetic relationships. By covering so many general aspects of crustacean development, morphology, and evolution, Evolutionary Developmental Biology of Crustacea serves as an indispensable reference for developmental and evolutionary biologists investigating the role of genetics in evolution and development.",9058096378,9789058096371,324,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aJAnh7CrOJsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=aJAnh7CrOJsC&pg=PA3&dq=Biology&hl=&cd=92&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=aJAnh7CrOJsC&dq=Biology&hl=&source=gbs_api

Here, for the first time within an evolutionary and ecological framework, Peter Price integrates the biological attributes that characterize parasites ranging from such diverse groups as viruses, bacteria, protozoa, and fungi, to helminths, mites, insects, and parasitic flowering plants. Synthesizing systematics, ecology, behavioral biology, genetics, and biogeography, the author outlines the success of parasitism as a mode of life, the common features of the wide range of organisms that adopt such a way of life, the reasons for parasites' extraordinary potential for continued adaptive radiation, and their role in molding community structure by means of their impact on the evolution of host species. In demonstrating the importance of parasitic interactions for determining population patterns and geographical distributions, Dr. Price generates further discussion and suggests new areas for research.",069108257X,9780691082578,260,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rGO0QPfcFkMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=rGO0QPfcFkMC&pg=PA175&dq=Biology&hl=&cd=93&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=rGO0QPfcFkMC&dq=Biology&hl=&source=gbs_api

Annals of the History and Philosophy of Biology 10/2005,N/A,Universitätsverlag Göttingen,2006,"The name DGGTB (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Geschichte und Theorie der Biologie; German Society for the History and Theory of Biology) reflects recent history as well as German tradition. The Society is a relatively late addition to a series of German societies of science and medicine that began with the »Deutsche Gesellschaft für Geschichte der Medizin und der Naturwissenschaften«, founded in 1910 by Leipzig University's Karl Sudhoff (1853-1938), who wrote: »We want to establish a ,German' society in order to gather German-speaking historians together in our special disciplines so that they form the core of an international society...«. Yet Sudhoff, at this time of burgeoning academic internationalism, was »quite willing« to accommodate the wishes of a number of founding members and »drop the word German in the title of the Society and have it merge with an international society«. The founding and naming of the Society at that time derived from a specific set of historical circumstances, and the same was true some 80 years later when in 1991, in the wake of German reunification, the »Deutsche Gesellschaft für Geschichte und Theorie der Biologie« was founded. From the start, the Society has been committed to bringing studies in the history and philosophy of biology to a wide audience, using for this purpose its Jahrbuch für Geschichte und Theorie der Biologie. Parallel to the Jahrbuch, the Verhandlungen zur Geschichte und Theorie der Biologie has become the by now traditional medium for the publication of papers delivered at the Society's annual meetings. In 2005 the Jahrbuch was renamed Annals of the History and Philosophy of Biology, reflecting the Society's internationalist aspirations in addressing comparative biology as a subject of historical and philosophical studies.",3938616393,9783938616390,213,N/A,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=byJk8Ea0WSQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=byJk8Ea0WSQC&pg=PA1&dq=Biology&hl=&cd=101&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=byJk8Ea0WSQC&dq=Biology&hl=&source=gbs_api

The Biology of Lemmings,"Nils Chr Stenseth, Rolf Anker Ims",Academic Press,1993,"The phenomenon of cyclic population fluctuation in small rodents, and specifically lemmings, has been a major issue in ecology for decades. A number of questions, both truly scientific and also of popular mythology,surround the biology of these animals. Although a tremendous amount of research has been carried out on lemmings, much remains to be resolved. And while the story of the suicidal rodent is now understood as myth, the facts behind the population behavior of lemmings require further study. In this book well-known ecologists Stenseth and Ims have brought together a number of leading experts from both North America and Europe to review our current understanding of the taxonomy, population biology, feeding, and community ecology of lemmings.The authors put this current, but rather fragmentary, understanding of lemming biology into a general population biological context.""In many ways we see lemmings as an important model species within population biology,""Stenseth acknowledges in the preface. Starting with the 16th Century, the book's introduction overviews the history of lemming research. The chapters are grouped into theme sections, each prefaced by an introductory review by the editors. The overall result is the most comprehensive and coherent overview of the subject to date.Finally, six appendices give detailed advice on how to study lemmings, which will provide an invaluable reference for research in the future.

"The Oxford Handbook of Evolution, Biology, and Society",Dr. Rosemary Hopcroft,Oxford University Press,2018-03-09,"Evolution, biology, and society is a catch-all phrase encompassing any scholarly work that utilizes evolutionary theory and/or biological or behavioral genetic methods in the study of the human social group, and The Oxford Handbook of Evolution, Biology, and Society contains an much needed overview of research in the area by sociologists and other social scientists. The examined topics cover a wide variety of issues, including the origins of social solidarity; religious beliefs; sex differences; gender inequality; determinants of human happiness; the nature of social stratification and inequality and its effects; identity, status, and other group processes; race, ethnicity, and race discrimination; fertility and family processes; crime and deviance; and cultural and social change. The scholars whose work is presented in this volume come from a variety of disciplines in addition to sociology, including psychology, political science, and criminology. Yet, as the essays in this volume demonstrate, the potential of theory and methods from biology for illuminating social phenomena is clear, and sociologists stand to gain from learning more about them and using them in their own work. The theory focuses on evolution by natural selection, the primary paradigm of the biological sciences, while the methods include the statistical analyses sociologists are familiar with, as well as other methods that they may not be familiar with, such as behavioral genetic methods, methods for including genetic factors in statistical analyses, gene-wide association studies, candidate gene studies, and methods for testing levels of hormones and other biochemicals in blood and saliva and including these factors in analyses. This work will be of interest to any sociologist with an interest in exploring the interaction of biological and sociological processes. As an introduction to the field it is useful for teaching upper-level or graduate students in sociology or a related social science.",0190299339,9780190299330,705,Social Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZhBQDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=ZhBQDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Biology&hl=&cd=162&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZhBQDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

"Instrumental Biology, Or The Disunity of Science",Alexander Rosenberg,University of Chicago Press,1994-11,"Do the sciences aim to uncover the structure of nature, or are they ultimately a practical means of controlling our environment? In Instrumental Biology, or the Disunity of Science, Alexander Rosenberg argues that while physics and chemistry can develop laws that reveal the structure of natural phenomena, biology is fated to be a practical, instrumental discipline. Because of the complexity produced by natural selection, and because of the limits on human cognition, scientists are prevented from uncovering the basic structure of biological phenomena. Consequently, biology and all of the disciplines that rest upon it—psychology and the other human sciences—must aim at most to provide practical tools for coping with the natural world rather than a complete theoretical understanding of it.",0226727254,9780226727257,212,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dNAitJHesboC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=dNAitJHesboC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Biology&hl=&cd=164&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=dNAitJHesboC&dq=Biology&hl=&source=gbs_api

This book is about the rich tapestry of life that shares our world now and about how we can maintain it, sometimes in places that we protect and set aside, more often in places where we share the lands and waters with a wide range of other species.” For more than 30 years, Fundamentals of Conservation Biology has been a valued mainstay of the literature, serving both to introduce new students to this ever-changing topic, and to provide an essential resource for academics and researchers working in the discipline. In the decade since the publication of the third edition, concerns about humanity’s efforts to conserve the natural world have only grown deeper, as new threats to biodiversity continue to emerge. This fourth edition has taken into account a vast new literature, and boasts nearly a thousand new references as a result.

Aspects of Physical Biology,"Giancarlo Franzese, Miguel Rubi",Springer,2008-12-02,"The application to Biology of the methodologies developed in Physics is attracting an increasing interest from the scientific community. It has led to the emergence of a new interdisciplinary field, called Physical Biology, with the aim of reaching a better understanding of the biological mechanisms at molecular and cellular levels. Statistical Mechanics in particular plays an important role in the development of this new field. For this reason, the XXth session of the famous Sitges Conference on Statistical Physics was dedicated to ""Physical Biology: from Molecular Interactions to Cellular Behavior"". As is by now tradition, a number of lectures were subsequently selected, expanded and updated for publication as lecture notes, so as to provide both a state-of-the-art introduction and overview to a number of subjects of broader interest and to favor the interchange and cross-fertilization of ideas between biologists and physicists. The present volume focuses on three main subtopics (biological water, protein solutions as well as transport and replication), presenting for each of them the on-going debates on recent results. The role of water in biological processes, the mechanisms of protein folding, the phases and cooperative effects in biological solutions, the thermodynamic description of replication, transport and neural activity, all are subjects that are revised in this volume, based on new experiments and new theoretical interpretations.",3540787658,9783540787655,236,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AHFqCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=AHFqCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Biology&hl=&cd=175&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AHFqCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api
Fungal Biology,Harry J. Hudson,CUP Archive,1991-01-03,"First published by Cambridge University Press in 1991, this book introduces fungi to readers from an ecological viewpoint, emphasising the ecological diversity and extreme versatility of the fungi. The introductory chapter covers fungal structure, growth and reproduction. The remaining chapters consider the fungi in their ecological roles, for example as decomposers of leaves, inhabitants of aquatic environments and as mutualistic symbionts in mycorrhiza and with insects. The intention is to treat fungi in terms of their adaptations to the ecosystems that they occupy. Although fungi as soil inhabitants are not included, much of their ecological significance is considered elsewhere, for example in the chapters on fungi as decomposers of leaves and wood. Examples given are worldwide, including from tropical countries, and the book is well illustrated with many original illustrations drawn from living material.",0521427738,9780521427739,310,Medical,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=S7I8AAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=S7I8AAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Biology&hl=&cd=176&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=S7I8AAAAIAAJ&dq=Biology&hl=&source=gbs_api
Conservation Biology for All,"Navjot S. Sodhi, Paul R. Ehrlich",Oxford University Press,2010-01-07,"Conservation Biology for All provides cutting-edge but basic conservation science to a global readership. A series of authoritative chapters have been written by the top names in conservation biology with the principal aim of disseminating cutting-edge conservation knowledge as widely as possible. Important topics such as balancing conversion and human needs, climate change, conservation planning, designing and analyzing conservation research, ecosystem services, endangered species management, extinctions, fire, habitat loss, and invasive species are covered. Numerous textboxes describing additional relevant material or case studies are also included. The global biodiversity crisis is now unstoppable; what can be saved in the developing world will require an educated constituency in both the developing and developed world. Habitat loss is particularly acute in developing countries, which is of special concern because it tends to be these locations where the greatest species diversity and richest centres of endemism are to be found. Sadly, developing world conservation scientists have found it difficult to access an authoritative textbook, which is particularly ironic since it is these countries where the potential benefits of knowledge application are greatest. There is now an urgent need to educate the next generation of scientists in developing countries, so that they are in a better position to protect their natural resources.",0199554234,9780199554232,369,Nature,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MxIUDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,4,1,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=MxIUDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Biology&hl=&cd=177&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=MxIUDAAAQBAJ&dq=Biology&hl=&source=gbs_api

"The Biology of Mosquitoes, Volume 3 Transmission of Viruses and Interactions with Bacteria",Alan N.

The largest part of this latest volume of The Biology of Mosquitoes concerns interactions between mosquitoes and viruses and the transmission of arboviruses to their vertebrate hosts, while the remainder concerns symbiotic interactions between mosquitoes and bacteria. The introduction provides a timely review of the first major development in mosquito taxonomy for several decades. Further chapters describe the interactions between mosquitoes and the viruses that infect them, the transmission and epidemiology of seven very important arboviruses, and the biology of bacteria that are important control agents or of great biological interest.

Philosophy of Biology Before Biology,"Cécilia Bognon-Küss, Charles T. Wolfe",History and Philosophy of Biology,2019-02-12,"The use of the term ""biology"" to refer to a unified science of life emerged around 1800 (most prominently by scientists such as Lamarck and Treviranus, although scholarship has indicated its usage at least 30-40 years earlier). The interplay between philosophy and natural science has also accompanied the constitution of biology as a science. Philosophy of Biology Before Biology examines biological and protobiological writings from the mid-eighteenth century to the early nineteenth century (from Buffon to Cuvier; Kant to Oken; and Kielmeyer) with two major sets of questions in mind: What were the distinctive conceptual features of the move toward biology as a science? What were the relations and differences between the ""philosophical"" focus on the nature of living entities, and the ""scientific"" focus? This insightful volume produces a fresh but also systematic perspective both on the history of biology as a science and on the early versions of, in the 1960s in a post-positivist context, the philosophy of biology.

Oxford Textbook of Cancer Biology,"Francesco Pezzella, Mahvash Tavassoli, David J. Kerr",Oxford University Press,2019-05-06,"The study of the biology of tumours has grown to become markedly interdisciplinary, involving chemists, statisticians, epidemiologists, mathematicians, bioinformaticians, and computer scientists alongside biologists, geneticists, and clinicians. The Oxford Textbook of Cancer Biology brings together the most up-to-date developments from different branches of research into one coherent volume, providing a comprehensive and current account of this rapidly evolving field. Structured in eight sections, the book starts with a review of the development and biology of multi-cellular organisms, how they maintain a healthy homeostasis in an individual, and a description of the molecular basis of cancer development. The book then illustrates, as once cells become neoplastic, their signalling network is altered and pathological behaviour follows. It explores the changes that cancer cells can induce in nearby normal tissue, the new relationship established between them and the stroma, and the interaction between the immune system and tumour growth. The authors illustrate the contribution provided by high throughput techniques to map cancer at different levels, from genomic sequencing to cellular metabolic functions, and how information technology, with its vast amounts of data, is integrated with traditional cell biology to provide a global view of the disease. The effect of the different types of treatments on the biology of the neoplastic cells are explored to understand on the one side, why some treatments succeed, and on the other, how they can affect the biology of resistant and recurrent disease. The book concludes by summarizing what we know to date about cancer, and in what direction our understanding of cancer is moving. Edited by leading authorities in the field with an international team of contributors, this book is an essential resource for scholars and professionals working in the wide variety of sub-disciplines that make up today's cancer research and treatment community.

Evolutionary Biology,"R. Paul Thompson, Denis Walsh",Cambridge University Press,2017-03-23,"Evolution - both the fact that it occurred and the theory describing the mechanisms by which it occurred - is an intrinsic and central component in modern biology. Theodosius Dobzhansky captures this well in the much-quoted title of his 1973 paper 'Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution'. The correctness of this assertion is even more obvious today: philosophers of biology and biologists agree that the fact of evolution is undeniable and that the theory of evolution explains that fact. Such a theory has far-reaching implications. In this volume, eleven distinguished scholars address the conceptual, metaphysical and epistemological richness of the theory and its ethical and religious impact, exploring topics including DNA barcoding, three grand challenges of human evolution, functionalism, historicity, design, evolution and development, and religion and secular humanism.

Death,Philippe Huneman,Springer Nature,2023-02-14,"This book addresses several key issues in the biological study of death with the intent of capturing their genealogy, the assumptions and presuppositions they make, and the way that they open specific new research avenues. The book is divided into two sections: the first considers physiology and the second evolutionary biology. In the first part, Huneman reconstructs a conceptual genealogy of experimental physiology based on an in-depth analysis of Bichat's investigations of death processes. In the second part he explains that biologists in the late 1950s put forth a research framework that evolutionarily accounts for death in terms of either an effect of the weakness of natural selection or a by-product of natural selection for early reproduction. He illustrates how the biology of death is a central field and that studying it provides insight into the way that the epistemic structure of this knowledge has been constituted, persists until now, and may conflict with some traditional philosophical ideas.",3031144171,9783031144172,552,Philosophy,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Fx6uEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=Fx6uEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Biology&hl=&cd=209&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Fx6uEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Biology and Molecular Biology of Plant-Pathogen Interactions,John A. Bailey,Springer Science & Business Media,2013-06-29,"This book is a collection of papers presented at a NATO Advanced Research Workshop on ""Biology and Molecular Biology of Plant-Pathogen Interactions"" which was held at Dillington College, Ilminster, UK, 1-6 September 1985. It had been preceded by Advanced Study Institutes at Porte Conte, Sardinia in 1975 and at Cape Sounion, Greece in 1981. In recent years, methods for the manipulation and transfer of genes have revolutionized our understanding of gene structure and function. It was thus opportune to bring together scientists from distinct disciplines, e. g. plant pathology, cytology, biochemistry and molecular biology to discuss our present understanding of cellular interactions between plants. We also explored how the potential offered by the newer molecular technologies could best be realized. It soon became evident at the Workshop, and is a repeated theme of this publication, that future research will need concentrated multi disciplinary programmes. Many of the new approaches will be valuable. For example, immunocytochemistry does, for the first time, allow molecules to be located precisely within infected tissues.

Forms of Becoming,Alessandro Minelli,Princeton University Press,2009,"What comes first, form or function? Evolutionary developmental biology (or ""evo-devo"") answers this fundamental question by showing how evolution controls the development of organisms. Alessandro Minelli takes an in-depth and comprehensive look at the history and key issues of evo-devo, focusing on the innovative ways animal organisms evolve through competition and cooperation. Minelli provides a complete overview of conceptual developments--from the fierce nineteenth-century debates between the French biologists Geoffroy and Cuvier, who fought over questions of form versus function--to modern theories of how genes dictate body formation. The book's wide-ranging topics include expression patterns of genes, developmental bias, the role of developmental genes, and genetic determinism. Drawing from diverse examples, such as the anatomy of butterflies, giraffes, Siamese twins, and corals, Minelli extends and reformulates important concepts from development, evolution, and the interplay between the two.",0691135681,9780691135687,252,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tDBiHhLg2uMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,3,1,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=tDBiHhLg2uMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Biology&hl=&cd=223&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=tDBiHhLg2uMC&dq=Biology&hl=&source=gbs_api
Concepts in Cell Biology - History and Evolution,"Vaidurya Pratap Sahi, František Baluška",Springer,2018-03-09,"This book discusses central concepts and theories in cell biology from the ancient past to the 21st century, based on the premise that understanding the works of scientists like Hooke, Hofmeister, Caspary, Strasburger, Sachs, Schleiden, Schwann, Mendel, Nemec, McClintock, etc. in the context of the latest advances in plant cell biology will help provide valuable new insights. Plants have been an object of study since the roots of the Greek, Chinese and Indian cultures. Since the term “cell” was first coined by Robert Hooke, 350 years ago in Micrographia, the study of plant cell biology has moved ahead at a tremendous pace. The field of cell biology owes its genesis to physics, which through microscopy has been a vital source for piquing scientists’ interest in the biology of the cell. Today, with the technical advances we have made in the field of optics, it is even possible to observe life on a nanoscale. From Hooke’s observations of cells and his inadvertent discovery of the cell wall, we have since moved forward to engineering plants with modified cell walls. Studies on the chloroplast have also gone from Julius von Sachs’ experiments with chloroplast, to using chloroplast engineering to deliver higher crop yields. Similarly, advances in fluorescent microscopy have made it far easier to observe organelles like chloroplast (once studied by Sachs) or actin (observed by Bohumil Nemec). If physics in the form of cell biology has been responsible for one half of this historical development, biochemistry has surely been the other.",3319699431,9783319699431,0,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Si65tAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=Si65tAEACAAJ&dq=Biology&hl=&cd=224&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=Si65tAEACAAJ&dq=Biology&hl=&source=gbs_api
"The Biology, Physiology and Sociology of Reproduction",Winfield Scott Hall,Books Explorer,1906,"Analyzing Winfield Scott Hall's ""The Biology, Physiology and Sociology of Reproduction,"" particularly given its historical context and also the advancements in relevant fields since its publication, entails considering different aspects: Scientific Content and Approach: Biology as well as Physiology: Hall examines the physiological and biological factors of reproduced sex, concentrating on the early twentieth century knowledge. Understand reproductive organs, sexual health, the fundamental principles of heredity. However advancements in genetics, molecule biology and reproductive technology would have made this information basic or obsolete. Male-Centric View: The book devotes particular attention to male sexual hygiene and health because of the medical and societal emphasis of the era. The contemporary science stresses a balanced approach to reproductive health for both genders. The Sociological Perspective: Cultural and Ethical Views: Hall consists of ethical and sociological discussions in his analysis, echoing the norms as well as values of the time. These include concepts regarding sexuality, morality and the social ramifications of reproduction. These viewpoints could appear dated or restricted out of a contemporary standpoint, considering the huge changes in societal attitudes to sexuality and reproductive rights. Gender Roles as well as Sexuality: The book most likely mirrors the early twentieth century gender norms and sexual ethics, which had been drastically distinct from present day acceptance and understanding of various sexual identities and identities. What's Historical Value: Educational Resource: The book is a historical account of the state of reproductive science and dominant community attitudes a century ago. It could be a crucial tool for understanding the evolution of reproductive health training. Reflection of Its Time: The book mirrors the scientific limitations and societal viewpoints of its age, which makes it an invaluable illustration of the evolution of social and medical thought. Relevance in Contemporary Context: The Comparative Study: Modern readers and researchers could use the book to compare present and past understanding and attitudes in reproductive science and sociology. Evolution of Thought: It spotlights advancements in reproductive health, gender analysis, and sociological awareness of sexualité and reproductive rights. Hall's work remains a major historical document, though it is definitely a product of its time when it comes to sociocultural perspective and scientific understanding. Additionally, it can serve as a reminder of how much society and science have advanced in understanding, beliefs and practices regarding human reproduction.",N/A,N/A,152,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mh88AQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=mh88AQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Biology&hl=&cd=225&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mh88AQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api

Frontiers in Mathematical Biology,Simon A. Levin,Springer Science & Business Media,2013-03-13,"From a mathematical point of view, physiologically structured population models are an underdeveloped branch of the theory of infinite dimensional dynamical systems. We have called attention to four aspects: (i) A choice has to be made about the kind of equations one extracts from the predominantly verbal arguments about the basic assumptions, and subsequently uses as a starting point for a rigorous mathematical analysis. Though differential equations are easy to formulate (different mechanisms don't interact in infinites imal time intervals and so end up as separate terms in the equations) they may be hard to interpret rigorously as infinitesimal generators. Integral equations constitute an attractive alternative. (ii) The ability of physiologically structured population models to increase our un derstanding of the relation between mechanisms at the i-level and phenomena at the p-level will depend strongly on the development of dynamical systems lab facilities which are applicable to this class of models. (iii) Physiologically structured population models are ideally suited for the for mulation of evolutionary questions.

Biological research in biodiversity contributes not only to understanding biodiversity itself but also to its conservation and utilization. The Biology of Biodiversity was the specialty area of the 1998 International Prize for Biology. The International Prize for Biology was established in 1985 in commemoration of the sixty-year reign of the Emperor Showa and his longtime devotion to biological research.

Biology in the Grid,Phillip Thurtle,U of Minnesota Press,2018-10-19,"How grids paved the way for our biological understanding of organisms As one of the most visual sciences, biology has an aesthetic dimension that lends force and persuasion to scientific arguments: how things are arranged on a page, how texts are interspersed with images, and how images are composed reflect deep-seated beliefs about how life exists on Earth. Biology in the Grid traces how our current understanding of life and genetics emerged from the pervasive nineteenth- and twentieth-century graphic form of the grid, which allowed disparate pieces of information to form what media theorist Vilém Flusser called “technical images.” Phillip Thurtle explains how the grid came to dominate biology in the twentieth century, transforming biologists’ beliefs about how organisms were constructed. He demonstrates how this shift in our understanding of biological grids enabled new philosophies in endeavors such as advertising, entertainment, and even political theory. The implications of the arguments in Biology in the Grid are profound, touching on matters as fundamental as desire, our understanding of our bodies, and our view of how society is composed. Moreover, Thurtle’s beautifully written, tightly focused arguments allow readers to apply his claims to new disciplines and systems. Bristling with insight and potential, Biology in the Grid ultimately suggests that such a grid-organized understanding of natural life inevitably has social and political dimensions, with society recognized as being made of interchangeable, regulated parts rather than as an organic whole.",1452957797,9781452957791,308,Art,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UVp1DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=UVp1DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Biology&hl=&cd=240&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UVp1DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

"A Civic Biology, Presented in Problems",George W. Hunter,DigiCat,2022-11-21,"George W. Hunter's 'A Civic Biology, Presented in Problems' remains a pivotal literary artifact, offering an unsettling glimpse into the early 20th-century American educational framework, especially the diffusion of eugenic ideology. The book weaves scientific concepts of its time with social theories, articulated in a pedagogical style that caters to problem-solving and critical thinking. Embedded within its narrative are the underpinnings of biological determinism and the once-mainstream acceptance of eugenics, which cast a somber shadow on its legacy. Notably, its contentious content precipitated the infamous Scopes Monkey Trial, serving as a catalyst for one of the most significant legal skirmishes over educational content and freedom of thought in the previous century. The book's position within the canon of educational texts offers insight into the historical confluence of science, society, and morality, thereby situating it as a crucial document for understanding the period's cultural and scientific milieu. As the primary author, George W. Hunter was a product of his era, crafting content that, albeit controversial, encapsulated the prevailing scientific thought of his time. Hunter's background in science education groomed his desire to instill a sense of civic duty through biology, though the ramifications of his work unfurled in ways that ultimately challenged the very fabric of American public discourse on education and ethics. His text stands as a testament to the enduring discussion about the role of education in shaping societal values and the responsibility of educators in presenting scientific ideas. Recommended for historians of science, educators, and anyone interested in the intersection of science and society, 'A Civic Biology, Presented in Problems' warrants examination. Through its study, one may glean insights into the complexities of pedagogical influence and the profound effects curricular choices have on public ideology and policy. This book is not just a relic of a bygone age, but a continuing conversation starter that urges us to reflect critically on the nexus between science education and societal norms.",N/A,N/A,466,Fiction,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZsKjEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=ZsKjEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Biology&hl=&cd=256&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=ZsKjEAAAQBAJ&dq=Biology&hl=&source=gbs_api

Computational Biology and Applied Bioinformatics,"Heitor Lopes, Leonardo Magalhães Cruz",BoD – Books on Demand,2011-09-02,"Nowadays it is difficult to imagine an area of knowledge that can continue developing without the use of computers and informatics. It is not different with biology, that has seen an unpredictable growth in recent decades, with the rise of a new discipline, bioinformatics, bringing together molecular biology, biotechnology and information technology. More recently, the development of high throughput techniques, such as microarray, mass spectrometry and DNA sequencing, has increased the need of computational support to collect, store, retrieve, analyze, and correlate huge data sets of complex information. On the other hand, the growth of the computational power for processing and storage has also increased the necessity for deeper knowledge in the field. The development of bioinformatics has allowed now the emergence of systems biology, the study of the interactions between the components of a biological system, and how these interactions give rise to the function and behavior of a living being. This book presents some theoretical issues, reviews, and a variety of bioinformatics applications. For better understanding, the chapters were grouped in two parts. In Part I, the chapters are more oriented towards literature review and theoretical issues.

Evolutionary Developmental Biology of Invertebrates 1,Andreas Wanninger,N/A,2015,"This multi-author, six-volume work summarizes our current knowledge on the developmental biology of all major invertebrate animal phyla. The main aspects of cleavage, embryogenesis, organogenesis and gene expression are discussed in an evolutionary framework. Each chapter presents an in-depth yet concise overview of both classical and recent literature, supplemented by numerous color illustrations and micrographs of a given animal group. The largely taxon-based chapters are supplemented by essays on topical aspects relevant to modern-day EvoDevo research such as regeneration, embryos in the fossil record, homology in the age of genomics and the role of EvoDevo in the context of reconstructing evolutionary and phylogenetic scenarios. A list of open questions at the end of each chapter may serve as a source of inspiration for the next generation of EvoDevo scientists. Evolutionary Developmental Biology of Invertebrates is a must-have for any scientist, teacher or student interested in developmental and evolutionary biology as well as in general invertebrate zoology. This volume starts off with three chapters that set the stage for the entire work by covering general aspects of EvoDevo research, including its relevance for animal phylogeny, homology issues in the age of developmental genomics, and embryological data in the fossil record. These are followed by taxon-based chapters on the animals that are commonly considered to have branched off the Animal Tree of Life before the evolution of the Bilateria: the Porifera, Placozoa, Cnidaria (with the Myxozoa being treated separately) and Ctenophora.

Biology and Ecology of Fishes,"James S. Diana, Tomas O. Höök",John Wiley & Sons,2023-07-17,"Biology and Ecology of Fishes Immerse yourself in the world of fish ecology with the newest edition of this essential introduction The study of fish ecology has traditionally proceeded along two tracks: the first is more basic, concerned with the anatomy, physiology and theoretical ecology of fish, and the second is more practical, concerning itself with fish populations, management, and habitats. Many fish researchers have come to view this distinction as artificial, and to develop a new study of fish that combines both tracks in a single holistic approach. It has never been more critical for introductory textbooks to represent this combined study in order to prepare the next generation of fish biologists and fishery scientists. Biology and Ecology of Fishes meets this need with a textbook that incorporates both biology and population management. Beginning with a general introduction to aquatic life and ecosystems, this book covers anatomical, environmental, and ethological topics to give a thoroughly rounded view of its subject, promising to serve as the fundamental introduction to multidisciplinary fish studies. Readers of the third edition of Biology and Ecology of Fishes will also find: Detailed coverage of subjects including growth and bioenergetics, feeding and predation, mortality and recruitment and more Increased attention to stressors of fish populations and communities New and revised chapters that introduce quantitative methods and present emerging issues facing fish populations and communities Biology and Ecology of Fishes is a useful overview for advanced undergraduate and graduate students studying fish ecology or fishery biology, as well as a reference for researchers and professionals in fish ecology, fish population management, and related fields.",1119505771,9781119505778,564,Technology & Engineering,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BUrCEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=BUrCEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Biology&hl=&cd=276&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=BUrCEAAAQBAJ&dq=Biology&hl=&source=gbs_api
Size Control in Biology,David Wake,N/A,2015,"Size is a primary feature of living things. From egg to adult, the various organs, tissues, cells, and subcellular structures that make up an organism grow to appropriate sizes so that they effectively fit and function together. The misregulation of this growth can lead to diseases such as cancer. Written and edited by experts in the field, this collection from Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology examines our current understanding of the intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms that precisely regulate the sizes of biological structures so that they can function efficiently in their cellular, organismal, or ecological context. Contributors discuss the various genetic, hormonal, and environmental inputs that trigger cells to grow, divide, or die, the various signaling pathways involved, and how these determine the final body size of an organism and the proportions of its component tissues and organs. Size-sensing mechanisms that enable cells to maintain their optimal sizes are reviewed, as are the scaling mechanisms that organelles use to adjust their sizes in response to changes in cell size. Examples from across the tree of life--from bacteria to humans--are provided. The authors also describe the mysteries that still remain about cell size and its control, including the nature of the intriguing relationship between nuclear DNA content and cell size. This volume will therefore be fascinating reading for all cell, developmental, and evolutionary biologists.",1621820726,9781621820727,0,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=q_BKrgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=q_BKrgEACAAJ&dq=Biology&hl=&cd=277&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=q_BKrgEACAAJ&dq=Biology&hl=&source=gbs_api
Population Biology of Vector-Borne Diseases,Oxford University Press,"Oxford University Press, USA",2020-09-25,"Population Biology of Vector-Borne Diseases is the first comprehensive survey of this rapidly developing field. The chapter topics provide an up-to-date presentation of classical concepts, reviews of emerging trends, synthesis of existing knowledge, and a prospective agenda for future research. The contributions offer authoritative and international perspectives from leading thinkers in the field. The dynamics of vector-borne diseases are far more intrinsically ecological compared with their directly transmitted equivalents. The environmental dependence of ectotherm vectors means that vector-borne pathogens are acutely sensitive to changing environmental conditions. Although perennially important vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue have deeply informed our understanding of vector-borne diseases, recent emerging viruses such as West Nile virus, Chikungunya virus, and Zika virus have generated new scientific questions and practical problems. The study of vector-borne disease has been a particularly rich source of ecological questions, while ecological theory has provided the conceptual tools for thinking about their evolution, transmission, and spatial extent.

These regions contain many rare and endemic species. Their mild climate makes them appealing places to live and visit and this has resulted in numerous threats to the species and communities that occupy them. Threats include a wide range of factors such as habitat loss due to development and agriculture, disturbance, invasive species, and climate change.

While neo-Darwinist biology has been powerfully served by its mechanistic metaphysic and a reductionist methodology in which living organisms are considered machines, many of the chapters in this volume place this paradigm into question. Pairing scientists and philosophers together, this volume explores what might be termed “the New Frontiers” of biology, namely contemporary areas of research that appear to call an updating, a supplementation, or a relaxation of some of the main tenets of the Modern Synthesis. Such areas of investigation include: Emergence Theory, Systems Biology, Biosemiotics, Homeostasis, Symbiogenesis, Niche Construction, the Theory of Organic Selection (also known as “the Baldwin Effect”), Self-Organization and Teleodynamics, as well as Epigenetics.

Urban Evolutionary Biology,"Marta Szulkin, Jason Munshi-South, Anne Charmantier",Oxford University Press,2020-05-05,"Urban Evolutionary Biology fills an important knowledge gap on wild organismal evolution in the urban environment, whilst offering a novel exploration of the fast-growing new field of evolutionary research. The growing rate of urbanization and the maturation of urban study systems worldwide means interest in the urban environment as an agent of evolutionary change is rapidly increasing. We are presently witnessing the emergence of a new field of research in evolutionary biology. Despite its rapid global expansion, the urban environment has until now been a largely neglected study site among evolutionary biologists. With its conspicuously altered ecological dynamics, it stands in stark contrast to the natural environments traditionally used as cornerstones for evolutionary ecology research. Urbanization can offer a great range of new opportunities to test for rapid evolutionary processes as a consequence of human activity, both because of replicate contexts for hypothesis testing, but also because cities are characterized by an array of easily quantifiable environmental axes of variation and thus testable agents of selection. Thanks to a wide possible breadth of inference (in terms of taxa) that may be studied, and a great variety of analytical methods, urban evolution has the potential to stand at a fascinating multi-disciplinary crossroad, enriching the field of evolutionary biology with emergent yet incredibly potent new research themes where the urban habitat is key. Urban Evolutionary Biology is an advanced textbook suitable for graduate level students as well as professional researchers studying the genetics, evolutionary biology, and ecology of urban environments. It is also highly relevant to urban ecologists and urban wildlife practitioners.",0192573845,9780192573841,318,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rJfgDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=rJfgDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Biology&hl=&cd=288&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rJfgDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Artemia: Basic and Applied Biology,"Th.J. Abatzopoulos, John Beardmore, J.S. Clegg, P. Sorgeloos",Springer,2013-01-11,"The objectives of this volume are to present an up-to-date (literature survey up to 2001) account of the biology of Artemia focusing particularly upon the major advances in knowledge and understanding achieved in the last fifteen or so years and emphasising the operational and functional linkage between the biological phenomena described and the ability of this unusual animal to thrive in extreme environments. Artemia is a genus of anostracan crustaceans, popularly known as brine shrimps. These animals are inhabitants of saline environments which are too extreme for the many species which readily predate them if opportunity offers. They are, thus, effectively inhabitants of extreme (hypersaline) habitats, but at the same time are able to tolerate physiologically large changes in salinity, ionic composition, temperature and oxygen tension. Brine shrimp are gener ally thought of as tropical and subtropical, but are also found in regions where temperatures are very low for substantial periods such as Tibet, Siberia and the Atacama desert. They have, thus, great powers of adaptation and are of interest for this capacity alone. The earliest scientific reference to brine shrimp is in 1756, when Schlosser reported their existence in the saltpans of Lymington, England. These saltpans no longer exist and brine shrimp are not found in Britain today. Later, Linnaeus named the brine shrimp Cancer salinus and later still, Leach used the name Artemia salina. The strong effect which the salinity of the medium exerts on the morphological development of Artemia is now widely recognised.",9401707928,9789401707923,286,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1AwbswEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=1AwbswEACAAJ&dq=Biology&hl=&cd=314&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=1AwbswEACAAJ&dq=Biology&hl=&source=gbs_api

Feminism and Evolutionary Biology,Patricia Gowaty,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Standing at the intersection of evolutionary biology and feminist theory is a large audience interested in the questions one field raises for the other. Have evolutionary biologists worked largely or strictly within a masculine paradigm, seeing males as evolving and females as merely reacting passively or carried along with the tide? Would our view of nature `red in tooth in claw' be different if women had played a larger role in the creation of evolutionary theory and through education in its transmission to younger generations? Is there any such thing as a feminist science or feminist methodology? For feminists, does any kind of biological determinism undermine their contention that gender roles purely constructed, not inherent in the human species? Does the study of animals have anything to say to those preoccupied with the evolution and behavior of humans? All these questions and many more are addressed by this book, whose contributing authors include leading scholars in both feminism and evolutionary biology.

They not only play key roles in the oceans but also represent an astounding amount of diversity: ecological morphological and genetic. However, for most taxa their ecology, morphology, phylogeny and biogeography are either poorly known or appear to be largely unrelated to one another; this hinders our understanding of their biology as well as interpretation of emerging genetic data.

Scaling in Biology,"James H. Brown, Geoffrey B. West, Santa Fe Institute (Santa Fe, N.M.)","Oxford University Press, USA",2000,"Scaling relationships have been a persistent theme in biology at least since the time of Leonardo da Vinci and Galileo. Because scaling relationships are among the most general empirical patterns in biology, they have stimulated research to develop mechanistic hypotheses and mathematical models. While there have been many excellent empirical and theoretical investigations, there has been little attempt to synthesize this diverse but interrelated area of biology. In an effort to fill this void, Scaling in Biology, the first general treatment of scaling in biology in over 15 years, covers a broad spectrum of the most relevant topics in a series of chapters written by experts in the field. Some of those topics discussed include allometry and fractal structure, branching of vascular systems of mammals and plants, biomechanical and life history of plants, invertebrates and vertebrates, and species-area patterns of biological diversity. Many more examples are included within this text to complete the broader picture. Scaling in Biology conveys the diversity, promise, and excitement of current research in this area, in a format accessible to a wide audience of not only specialists in the various sub-disciplines, but also students and anyone with a serious interest in biology.",019513141X,9780195131413,352,Medical,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AG-9QgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=AG-9QgAACAAJ&dq=Biology&hl=&cd=325&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=AG-9QgAACAAJ&dq=Biology&hl=&source=gbs_api
Biochemistry and Biology of Coronaviruses,"V. Ter Meulen, S. Siddell, H. Wege",Springer,1981,"This book is the result of an international symposium held at the Institute of Virology and Immunobiology of the-University of WUrzburg, Germany, in October 1980. The intent of this symposium was to provide an opportunity to compare the data on coronavirus structure and replica tion as well as to discuss mechanisms of pathogenesis. For over a decade coronaviruses have been recognized as an important group of viruses which are responsible for a variety of diseases of clinical importance in animals and man. Recently new and interesting data on the molecular biology and pathogenesis of coronaviruses have become available and this led us to organize this meeting. The uniformity and diversity in this virus group was evaluated from a molecular point of view and the replication of coronaviruses appears to involve aspects which may be unique for this virus group. Additionally, in contrast to other positive strand RNA viruses it became clear that coronaviruses readily establish persistent infections in the host, a phenomenon which may lead to the different subacute or chronic disorders manifested during coronavirus infection. This volume presents a series of articles based upon the scientific presentation given at the symposium. In addition, there are two articles by B. W. J. Mahy and D. A. J. Tyrrell which summarize the current state of art concerning the biochemistry and biology of coronaviruses, respective ly.

Conifer Reproductive Biology,Claire G. Williams,Springer Science & Business Media,2009-05-19,"When it comes to reproduction, gymnosperms are deeply weird. Cycads and co- fers have drawn out reproduction: at least 13 genera take over a year from polli- tion to fertilization. Since they don’t apparently have any selection mechanism by which to discriminate among pollen tubes prior to fertilization, it is natural to w- der why such a delay in reproduction is necessary. Claire Williams’ book celebrates such oddities of conifer reproduction. She has written a book that turns the context of many of these reproductive quirks into deeper questions concerning evolution. The origins of some of these questions can be traced back Wilhelm Hofmeister’s 1851 book, which detailed the revolutionary idea of alternation of generations. This alternation between diploid and haploid generations was eventually to become one of the key unifying ideas in plant evolution. Dr. Williams points out that alter- tion of generations in conifers shows strong divergence in the evolution of male and female gametes, as well as in the synchronicity of male and female gamete development. How are these coordinated to achieve fertilization? Books on conifer reproduction are all too rare. The only major work in the last generation was Hardev Singh’s 1978 Embryology of Gymnosperms, a book that summarized the previous century’s work. Being a book primarily about embry- ogy, it stopped short of putting conifer reproduction in a genetic or evolutionary context.",1402096011,9781402096013,174,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4ew2xYN8vVUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=4ew2xYN8vVUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Biology&hl=&cd=327&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=4ew2xYN8vVUC&dq=Biology&hl=&source=gbs_api

Mikos",N/A,2023,"""As in the first edition of this book, we continue to believe that the field of biomaterials has evolved over approximately the past 60+ years from the intersection of multiple disparate viewpoints, including materials science, biology, engineering, and clinical, business, and regulatory perspectives. With this history, the multidisciplinary nature of biomaterials is inescapable. As educators in this field, we understand the challenges of preparing students with a broad range of backgrounds to address the complex issues associated with designing and implementing new biomedical devices. With this in mind, we originally set out to write a balanced and cohesive textbook that would introduce fundamental concepts of biomaterials to undergraduate engineering majors in their second year of study or later. Given this target audience, like the first edition, this text assumes basic knowledge of chemistry and physics, but does not require in-depth exposure to more complex mathematical concepts such as partial differential equations, or any knowledge of cell biology or biochemistry""--",0134605454,9780134605456,N/A,Biomedical materials,en,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=44KfzgEACAAJ&dq=Biology&hl=&cd=333&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=44KfzgEACAAJ&dq=Biology&hl=&source=gbs_api

The Evolutionary Biology Papers of Elie Metchnikoff,"H. Gourko, D. Williamson, A.I. Tauber",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-04-17,"Elie Metchnikoff (1845-1916), winner of the Nobel Prize in 1907 for his contributions to immunology, was first a comparative zoologist, who, working in the wake of Darwin's On the Origin of Species, made seminal contributions to evolutionary biology. His work in comparative embryology is best known in regard to the debates with Ernst Haeckel concerning animal genealogical relationships and the theoretical origins of metazoans. But independent of those polemics, Metchnikoff developed his `phagocytosis theory' of immunity as a result of his early comparative embryology research, and only in examining the full breadth of his work do we appreciate his signal originality. Metchnikoff's scientific papers have remained largely untranslated into English. Assembled here, annotated and edited, are the key evolutionary biology papers dating from Metchnikoff's earliest writings (1865) to the texts of his mature period of the 1890s, which will serve as an invaluable resource for those interested in the historical development of evolutionary biology.",9401593817,9789401593816,248,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PO8sBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=PO8sBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Biology&hl=&cd=335&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PO8sBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api
Mortalin Biology,N/A,N/A,2012,"The phrase Life, stress and death connects three terms, but is there a biological basis for that? Are there molecules that are essential to/or mediate these phenomena? This contributory volume Mortalin Biology: Life, Stress and Death is a remarkable compilation of the research outcomes on the stress protein mortalin, a member of heat shock 70 family of proteins. The book is unique as it describes mortalin playing essential role in life, stress response and death either from cancer, when it becomes hyperactive or from neuro-degeneration, when it becomes hypoactive. The book provides up-to-date knowledge on mortalin with respect to its discovery, structure, evolutionary conservation, function and signal transduction in different organisms in a simple, but most comprehensive way, that besides offering an enjoyable and in-depth reading, prompts the reader to ask further questions to explore this protein with new ideas, approaches and experiments. Twenty-one chapters by the world leaders on the specific areas of mortalin research throw light on its multi-functionality, potentials for biotechnology, diagnostics and therapeutic values.

Molecular Biology of Diabetes,"Boris Draznin, Derek LeRoith",Humana Press,2012-09-27,"In a rapidly evolving and extremely important area of medical science, it is often difficult for the student, teacher, and researcher to keep abreast of all the important advances. The purpose of Molecular Biology ofDiabetes, Parts I and II is to bring to these individuals the latest knowledge of diabetes-related research in a comprehensive, yet concise manner. To this end, we have assembled chapters, written by most of the world's experts in the field, that we believe compre hensively survey and synthesize a coherent understanding of the subject. Studies of the etiology of type I and type II diabetes are extremely exciting and essential, since we hope to one day prevent the disease using gene therapy. These aspects are covered in Molecular Biology of Diabetes: I. Autoimmunity and Genetics; Insulin Synthesis and Secretion. In type II diabetes, an abnormality in pancreatic secretion exists concomitantly with peripheral insulin resistance. This abnor mality of insulin secretion is believed to be related to a defect(s) in glucose sensing. Uncoupling of glucose sensing from insulin secre tion may be the crucial step in the pathogenesis of noninsulin-depen dent diabetes. In this volume, we have invited authors to describe their studies on all known factors affecting ~-cell function, including autoimmunity and genetics of diabetes, as well as molecular mecha nisms of insulin synthesis and secretion.

The Biology of Numbers,"Giorgio Israel, Ana M. Gasca",Birkhäuser,2013-03-07,"Foreword The modern developments in mathematical biology took place roughly between 1920 and 1940, a period now referred to as the ""Golden Age of Theoretical Biology"". The eminent Italian mathematician Vito Volterra played a decisive and widely acknowledged role in these developments. Volterra's interest in the application of mathematics to the non physical sciences, and to biology and economics in particular, dates back to the turn of the century and was expressed in his inaugural address at the University of Rome for the academic year 1900/01 (VOLTERRA 1901). Nevertheless, it was only in the mid-twenties that Volterra entered the field in person, at the instigation of his son in law, Umberto D'Ancona, who had confronted him with the problem of competition among animal species, asking him whether a mathematical treatment was possible. From that time on, until his death in 1940, Volterra produced a huge output of publications on the subject. Volterra's specific project was to transfer the model and the concepts of classical mechanics to biology, constructing a sort of ""rational mechanics"" and an ""analytic mechanics"" of biological associations. The new subject was thus to be equipped with a solid experimental or at least empirical basis, also in this case following the tried and tested example of mathematical physics. Although very few specific features of this reductionist programme have actually survived, Volterra's contribution was decisive, as is now universally acknowledged, in en couraging fresh studies in the field of mathematical biology.",3034881231,9783034881234,414,Mathematics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cyPyBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=cyPyBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Biology&hl=&cd=350&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cyPyBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Fourier descriptors refers to the utilization of Fourier analysis, primarily the Fourier series as a curve fitting technique, that can numerically describe the shape of irregular structures such as are commonly found in living organisms. The quantitative characterization of irregular forms is often the first step toward elucidation of the underlying biological processes, whether they be genetic, evolutionary, or functional.

Pollen,"R.G. Stanley, H.F. Linskens",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Pollen transmits the male genetic material in sexual reproduction of all higher plants. This same pollen is also well suited as a research tool for studying many patterns of plant and animal metabolism. In addition, an increased knowledge of pollen may help plant breeders accelerate efforts to improve the world's food and fiber supply. This volume focuses upon pollen biology and chemistry; it attempts to inte grate these facts with management practices involved in pollen applications. People have long been involved with pollen. Pollen applications are recorded in the rites of ancient civilizations (see Frontispiece). From the earliest times many benefits have been attributed to the inclusion of pollen in man's diet; also, since the mid-19th century air-borne pollen has been recognized as detrimental to many people's health. Disciplines concerned with man's cultural history and the earth's changing ecology find pollen a particularly useful and accessible tool. Identifiable parts of pollen have survived over 100 million years. But most books dealing with pollen are generally concerned with the identification of the plant source, an aspect of the science of palynology; other books emphasize the natural vectors transmit ting pollen, the pollination mechanisms. Very few works include the biochem istry or biology of pollen.

This book explains the basic biological principles of coping with many forms of adversity. The major part of this work is devoted to explaining scientifically usable concepts in stress and welfare. A wide range of welfare indicators are highlighted in detail with examples being drawn from man and other species. The necessity for combining information from disciplines is emphasized with a one-health, one-welfare approach. This information forms the basis for a synthesis of new ideas. Among the issues covered are: - How brain and body systems regulate using feelings, physiological responses, behaviour and responses to pathology - Limits to adaptation - Assessing positive and negative welfare during both short-term and long-term situations - Ethical problems and suggested solutions A proper assessment of animal welfare is essential to take informed decisions about what is morally acceptable in terms of practice and in the development of a more effective legislation.
