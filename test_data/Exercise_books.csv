The Lean Look,"Paul Goldberg, Matthew Fitzgerald",Harmony,2009-05-06,"Achieve the lean, fit look of a professional athlete in just twelve weeks with this straightforward fitness plan. New studies are confirming what Paul Goldberg has already observed in his high-profile clients: getting leaner—not just thinner—is the single most important change that we can make to feel and look our best. What many Americans struggle with today is known as normal weight obesity: normal body weight, but high body-fat percentage, which can lead to serious health problems. Now Goldberg has developed an effective plan to lower body fat by eating the right foods and building muscle. The twelve-week Lean Look program requires no fancy equipment, takes thirty minutes a day, six days a week, and can easily be done at home. Goldberg shows how to add foods to your diet that promote muscle development, cut back on foods that encourage fat storage, time your meals for optimal nutrition, and exercise to burn fat.

The Theory of Gymnastics,J. Lindhard,Routledge,2018-12-14,"First published in 1939, this volume translated into English the Danish work ‘Den Specielle Gymnastrikteon’. Its author, Professor Lindhard, noted the still-young field of theoretical gymnastics in comparison to its physical counterpart, with the only prior major work being that of Ling from 1800. Lindhard developed upon that work to revolutionise the 1930s interpretation of Ling’s views. The author of several physiological books, Lindhard sought to explain how gymnastics was a means of developing both physical form and moral qualities. He emphasised the importance of guidance towards ethical and aesthetical gymnastics and explored the differences between men, women and children with regards to each form of exercise. This was achieved through the classification, description and contemplation of exercises such as corrective, balance and athletic exercises along with demonstrative illustrations.",0429870795,9780429870798,372,Sports & Recreation,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=imAPEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=imAPEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA82&dq=Exercise&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=imAPEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Non Pharmacological Therapies in the Management of Osteoarthritis,"Yves Henrotin, Kim Bennell, Francois Rannou",Bentham Science Publishers,2012-03-31,"Osteoarthritis is a chronic disease prevalent among the elderly. Its most prominent feature is the progressive destruction of articular cartilage which results in impaired joint motion, severe pain and ultimately disability. Its prevalence and its impact on daily life pose a significant public health problem. Today, a cure for osteoarthritis remains elusive and the management of the disease is largely palliative, focusing on the alleviation of symptoms. Current recommendations include a combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments. The term “non-pharmacological” includes physical therapy and rehabilitation, but also nutraceuticals. All guidelines on osteoarthritis management highlight the importance of weight loss and physical activity to improve the functional status of patients. A number of alternative therapies are also commonly suggested by physicians and physiotherapists in their daily practice. The efficacy of these therapies is not evidenced by strong clinical trials. This category includes education, information, electrotherapy, ultrasound, electromagnetic field, spa, hydrotherapy, acupuncture, etc. Non Pharmacological Therapies in the Management of Osteoarthritis reviews the clinical relevance of these therapies and the difficulties in conducting high quality trials assessing their efficacy. This e-book presents supportive scientific evidence for their efficacy and explains the mechanism of action of nutraceuticals targeting osteoarthritis. It also includes many example of exercises, mobilization and manipulation techniques directly useful for medical professionals.",1608053172,9781608053179,137,Medical,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YB8yDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=YB8yDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA53&dq=Exercise&hl=&cd=24&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=YB8yDgAAQBAJ&dq=Exercise&hl=&source=gbs_api

Principles of Gender-Specific Medicine,Marianne Legato J,Academic Press,2017-05-15,"The announcement that we had decoded the human genome in 2000 ushered in a new and unique era in biomedical research and clinical medicine. This Third Edition of Principles of Gender-Specific Medicine focuses, as in the past two editions, on the essentials of sexual dimorphism in human physiology and pathophysiology, but emphasizes the latest information about molecular biology and genomic science in a variety of disciplines. Thus, this edition is a departure from the previous two; the editor solicited individual manuscripts from innovative scientists in a variety of fields rather than the traditional arrangement of sections devoted to the various subspecialties of medicine edited by section chiefs. Wherever it was available, these authors incorporated the latest information about the impact of the genome and the elements that modify its expression on human physiology and illness. All chapters progress translationally from basic science to the clinical applications of gender-specific therapy and suggest the most important topics for future investigation. This book is essential reading for all biomedical investigators and medical educators involved in gender-specific medicine. It will also be useful for primary care practitioners who need information about the importance of sex and gender in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illness.

"The Detox Book, 3rd Edition",Bruce Fife,"Piccadilly Books, Ltd.",2017-08-14,"We live in a toxic world. Environmental pollution and disease-causing germs assault us continually day after day. Our food is nutrient deficient and our water supply dangerously contaminated. People today are exposed to chemicals in far greater concentrations then were previous generations. Thousands of tons of man-made chemicals and industrial pollutants are poured into our environment and our food supply daily. With such a massive attack on our health we should all be sick from toxic overload. And we are! In no other time in the history of the world has degenerative disease been as prominent as it is today. Diseases that were rare or unheard of a century ago are now raging upon us like a plague. Millions are dying from diseases that were virtually unknown in the past. Experts tell us that by the time we reach middle age, each one of us will have already been affected by either cancer, cardiovascular disease, or some other serious degenerative condition. Conventional medicine has no sure cure. Drugs, surgery, and radiation treatments can be as dangerous and debilitating as the diseases they attempt to cure. Nature, however, has provided us with the solution. Our bodies are amazingly resilient. If the disease-causing toxins are removed, the body will heal itself. This book outlines the steps you need to take to thoroughly detoxify and cleanse your body from these disease-causing agents. You will also learn how to reduce your toxic exposure and how to strengthen your immune system. Through detoxification you will free yourself from the chains of pain, reverse degenerative conditions, gain more energy, feel and look younger, improve your memory, and be happier. Virtually all the diseases of modern society, including many infectious illnesses, can be avoided or even cured by sensible systematic detoxification. Although we live in a toxic world we can take control of our health. This book will show you how. “The Detox Book is highly recommended for health reference collections.” ―The Midwest Book Review “A comprehensive handbook of detoxification therapies...

Movement Training for Actors,Jackie Snow,Bloomsbury Publishing,2012-12-20,"""This book vividly captures vital and imaginative lessons from one of the most influential and joyous traditions of contemporary actor training. Any actor or teacher, who is devoted to the transformational power of the theatre, will want to return to these pages again and again, finding in them not only the work to be done, but also the inspiration to do it."" James Bundy - Dean, Yale School of Drama; Artistic Director, Yale Repertory Theatre Movement training techniques allow actors to acquire the physical body language and non-verbal skills to clearly express the ideas and emotions of their characters. The techniques contained in this book help actors to develop awareness of their own natural posture, walk and rhythm, release the physical imagination and transform into the characters they are portraying, on stage, in film or on television. Movement Training for Actors provides a practical workbook approach to the core fundamentals of movement, fusing together the work of the key practitioners: Sigurd Leeder, Kurt Jooss, Rudolf Laban, Trish Arnold, Litz Pisk, F. M. Alexander, Moshé Feldenkrais, Jerzy Growtowski, Jacques Lecoq and Belinda Quirey. Chapters include Games, Pure Movement, Historical Dance, Acrobatics and Animal Study. The book is illustrated with photographs throughout and contains a DVD featuring over an hour of movement exercises further demonstrating the techniques. Movement Training for Actors is a masterclass on movement written by experienced coach, Jackie Snow and a culmination of her many years of teaching and coaching professionals. The highly practical approach will suit actors of all abilities as well as serving as an inspirational teaching guide.",1472515218,9781472515216,210,Drama,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=k4RFDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=k4RFDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA193&dq=Exercise&hl=&cd=88&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=k4RFDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

This version is available only for courses using the sixth edition and will be discontinued at the end of the semester. Physiology of Sport and Exercise, Sixth Edition With Web Study Guide, frames research findings in physiology in a reader-friendly format, making this textbook a favorite of instructors and students alike. This resource offers a simple way for students to develop an understanding of the body’s abilities to perform various types and intensities of exercise and sport, to adapt to stressful situations, and to improve its physiological capacities. Written by a team of distinguished researchers, all past presidents of the American College of Sports Medicine, this updated sixth edition has been enhanced with new elements to facilitate learning comprehension. The redesigned photos, illustrations, and medical artwork of the fifth edition that clarified difficult concepts and illustrated how the body performs are now complemented by new digital components. Seven animations have been added, bringing the total to 25 and providing a dynamic way to experience course material. The 60 audio clips provide explanations of complex physiological processes to aid students’ understanding of important illustrations in the text, and approximately 20 video clips from leaders in the field discuss recent developments and real-world applications to help students connect theoretical and practical concepts. Corresponding icons throughout the text notify students when digital elements are available to complement the materials. In addition to the improved digital components, Physiology of Sport and Exercise, Sixth Edition, features new and updated content based on the latest research in the field: • Updated information on high-intensity interval training (HIIT), interactions between resistance training and diet, and the relationship between protein intake and muscle synthesis • A reorganized chapter on ergogenic aids and a clearer organization of prohibited versus legal substances • Extensively revised chapters on physical activity and disease, including updated treatment guidelines and understandings of metabolism and disease processes • New information on the health effects of prolonged sitting as well as osteoporosis, bone health, and effects of exercise during menopause • A series of 76 Research Perspectives emphasizing new and emerging findings in the field Ease of reading has been the cornerstone of this popular text. The sixth edition of Physiology of Sport and Exercise continues to offer comprehensive coverage of the complex relationship between human physiology and exercise while maintaining an engaging and student-friendly tone.

Study questions and a list of key terms at the end of the chapter increase students’ opportunities for recall and self-testing. A comprehensive glossary and lists of common abbreviations and conversions provide easy reference for students as they complete labs and assignments. To expand the material and provide an enriched learning experience, both students and instructors can take advantage of the web-based ancillaries that accompany the text. In addition to new animations, videos, and audio clips, the web study guide includes comprehension quizzes to provide immediate feedback to students on their knowledge retention as well as end-of-unit mastery checks that students can use for evaluating their progress. Instructors are provided with access to an instructor guide, test package, ready-to-use chapter quizzes, and a presentation package plus image bank. The presentation package includes PowerPoint slides with key points and content, which can be modified to suit a variety of class structures. An image bank features all of the graphics, artwork, and content photos from the text for easy insertion into tests, quizzes, handouts, and other course materials. Digital extras—composed of the animations, videos, and audio clips that students find in the web study guide—bolster comprehension of challenging concepts.

Methods of Group Exercise Instruction,"Carol K. Armbruster, Mary M. Yoke",Human Kinetics,2014-01-30,"Formats, modalities, and trends in group exercise are constantly evolving. Methods of Group Exercise Instruction, Third Edition With Online Video, explores the most common group exercise modalities, enhancing readers’ marketability by giving them the skills to lead dynamic, safe, and effective classes. This text highlights the commonalities of a variety of group exercise formats through training principles, correction and progression techniques, and safety tips to enhance the skills of both group exercise leaders and program directors. Methods of Group Exercise Instruction, Third Edition, moves from theory to practice in a logical progression. Rather than simply providing routines, this book helps instructors develop the core skills needed for creating routines, use proper cueing, and adapt their teaching to new modalities. Teaching techniques convey appropriate training for each muscle group and methods for warm-up, cardiorespiratory training, muscular conditioning, neuromotor training, and flexibility. In addition, starter routines, modification strategies, and instructor assessment criteria are presented for seven class formats: kickboxing, step training, stationary indoor cycling, sport conditioning and boot camp, water exercise, yoga, and mat-based Pilates. The text also touches on alternative modalities, including dance-based classes, fusion, and mind–body training. Thoroughly revised and reorganized based on industry standards, the third edition of Methods of Group Exercise Instruction offers expanded content to help readers become better instructors. Updates to the third edition include the following: • Online video, totaling over 100 minutes, demonstrates key content in the text. • New chapters cover social aspects of group exercise, coaching-based instructional models, and neuromotor and functional training. • Callout boxes highlight important topics, research findings, technique and safety checks, and practice drills, which facilitate quick learning. • Short assignments at the close of each chapter encourage readers to look beyond the text to gain practical experience. • Evaluation forms and evaluation key points allow instructors to gauge their teaching success and adapt the key criteria of a successful class to each exercise modality. The three-part structure of this book is retained from the previous edition, but the content is reorganized to better reflect industry standards and guidelines. Part I provides a general overview of group exercise: the evolution and advantages of group exercise; the strategies for creating group cohesion in a class; the core concepts in class design; and the use of music, choreography, and cueing methods in designing and leading a class. Part II offers guidelines for leading the four major segments of a group exercise class: warm-up, cardiorespiratory training, muscular conditioning, and ﬂexibility training, and includes a new chapter on neuromotor and functional training. These basic concepts pertain to all modalities covered in part III, which focuses on practical teaching skills. Basic moves, choreography, and training systems are covered for each type of class. Sample routines and class formats for each modality offer a confident starting point for novice instructors and fresh material for veterans. The final chapter discusses customized or hybrid classes such as lifestyle physical activity–based classes, equipment-based cardio classes, and mind and body classes. When used as a course text, Methods of Group Exercise Instruction, Third Edition, includes instructor ancillaries, which offer suggestions for effective use of the book and online video, lesson plan outlines, a sample week-by-week syllabus, lab activities, and test questions. The third edition also features a newly added image bank containing all the figures and photos from the text to use in presentations.",1492583650,9781492583653,440,Health & Fitness,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JPN6DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=JPN6DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Exercise&hl=&cd=351&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=JPN6DwAAQBAJ&dq=Exercise&hl=&source=gbs_api

Exercise for Mood and Anxiety,"Michael Otto Ph.D., Jasper A.J. Smits Ph.D.",Oxford University Press,2011-07-28,"Exercise has long been touted anecdotally as an effective tool for mood improvement, but only recently has rigorous science caught up with these claims. There is now overwhelming evidence that regular exercise can help relieve low mood-from feelings of stress and anxiety to full depressive episodes. With Exercise for Mood and Anxiety, Michael Otto and Jasper Smits, well-known authorities on cognitive behavioral therapy, take their empirically-based mood regulation strategy from the clinic to the general public. Written for those with diagnosed mood disorders as well as those who simply need a new strategy for managing the low mood and stress that is an everyday part of life, this book provides readers with step-by-step guidance on how to start and maintain an exercise program geared towards improving mood, with a particular emphasis on understanding the relationship between mood and motivation. Readers learn to attend carefully to mood states prior to and following physical activity in order to leverage the full benefits of exercise, and that the trick to maintaining an exercise program is not in applying more effort, but in arranging one's environment so that less effort is needed. As a result readers not only acquire effective strategies for adopting a successful program, but are introduced to a broader philosophy for enhancing overall well-being. Providing patient vignettes, rich examples, and extensive step-by-step guidance on overcoming the obstacles that prevent adoption of regular exercise for mood, Exercise for Mood and Anxiety is a unique translation of scientific principles of clinical and social psychology into an action-based strategy for mood change.",0199831793,9780199831791,246,Health & Fitness,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZHlyIRW-ttwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=ZHlyIRW-ttwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Exercise&hl=&cd=355&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZHlyIRW-ttwC&source=gbs_api

Pilates on the Ball,Colleen Craig,Simon and Schuster,2001-09-01,"A unique and exciting synthesis of two highly acclaimed fitness techniques: Pilates Method and the Swiss exercise ball. • Non-impact Pilates exercises on the ball can be adapted for all levels of ability, from fitness trainers and weekend athletes to those healing from injury or chronic back pain. • Shows how to practice Pilates techniques without expensive equipment. • Profusely illustrated with black-and-white photographs for maximal learning. The Pilates Method of body conditioning is a highly effective workout technique that strengthens the body while engaging the mind. Developed in the early twentieth century by accomplished boxer and gymnast Joseph Pilates, the Pilates Method aligns the body; builds long, lean muscles; and develops core abdominal strength. Many lifestyle and fitness magazines have named Pilates the hottest workout of the decade. In a first-of-its-kind fusion, Pilates on the Ball merges the principles and exercises of the highly effective Pilates Method of body conditioning with the unique functions of the exercise ball, used by Olympic coaches, dancers, and athletes to fine-tune body awareness and enhance physical performance. The ball magnifies the benefits of the carefully developed and refined Pilates Method. Because maintaining balance on the ball recruits the deep, stabilizing muscles of the spine, the postural muscles are strengthened. The ball intensifies athletic performance by increasing resistance and heightening awareness of how the body moves in space. Chapters detail the Pilates principles step by step, with successive movements to challenge all levels of ability and ""watch points"" for careful evaluation of your form. Intense enough to engage seasoned athletes yet accessible enough to use as an everyday exercise routine or to alleviate chronic pain, Pilates on the Ball builds strong bodies and engaged minds.",1594775931,9781594775932,229,Health & Fitness,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lFsoDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=lFsoDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Exercise&hl=&cd=372&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lFsoDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Foundations of Exercise Psychology,"Bonnie G. Berger, David Pargman, Robert Stephen Weinberg",N/A,2007,"Though exercise is relatively easy to do, its influence on our physical, psychological, and spiritual well-being is complex. Even those who are aware of its positive effects are sometimes reluctant to begin. Why do some people maintain a regular exercise regimen while others quit after a few weeks? How does exercise influence mental health? If medical, health, fitness, psychology, and athletic professionals are to help their clients, they must understand the issues that surround the psychology of exercise. 'Foundations of Exercise Psychology' presents a summary of the information to date on the psychology of exercise and offers lucid suggestions for practice and future research. 'Foundations of Exercise Psychology' will help to shape the direction of the field of exercise psychology for many years to come, and it will do much to encourage young professionals to enter the field and to pursue further study. Students moving toward the exercise professions will gain a solid background in key issues surrounding exercise and health and make great strides forward in becoming competent and compassionate practitioners. The contents of the book go well beyond past texts in the field and include some innovative and thought-provoking chapters on little discussed topics in exercise psychology such as the meaning of exercise and the psychological and physical dangers when exercise goes awry. The text spends considerable time exploring the relationship between exercise and personality, self-esteem, self-concept, mood alteration and motivation -- concepts and features of being human that are all intimately related. The range of populations examined includes women, children, dependent and habitual exercisers, and participants throughout the life span.",1885693699,9781885693693,0,Exercise,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QXaTNQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=QXaTNQAACAAJ&dq=Exercise&hl=&cd=377&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=QXaTNQAACAAJ&dq=Exercise&hl=&source=gbs_api

The Routledge Handbook on Biochemistry of Exercise,"Peter M. Tiidus, Rebecca E. K. MacPherson, Paul J. LeBlanc, Andrea R. Josse",Routledge,2020-12-28,"From its early beginnings in the 1960s, the academic field of biochemistry of exercise has expanded beyond examining and describing metabolic responses to exercise and adaptations to training to include a wide understanding of molecular biology, cell signalling, interorgan communication, stem cell physiology, and a host of other cellular and biochemical mechanisms regulating acute responses and chronic adaptations related to exercise performance, human health/disease, nutrition, and cellular functioning. The Routledge Handbook on Biochemistry of Exercise is the first book to pull together the full depth and breadth of this subject and to update a rapidly expanding field of study with current issues and controversies and a look forward to future research directions. Bringing together many experts and leading scientists, the book emphasizes the current understanding of the underlying metabolic, cellular, genetic, and cell signalling mechanisms associated with physical activity, exercise, training, and athletic performance as they relate to, interact with, and regulate cellular and muscular adaptations and consequent effects on human health/disease, nutrition and weight control, and human performance. With more emphasis than ever on the need to be physically active and the role that being active plays in our overall health from a whole-body level down to the cell, this book makes an important contribution for scholars, medical practitioners, nutritionists, and coaches/trainers working in research and with a wide range of clients.

"Exercise, Sport, and Bioanalytical Chemistry",Anthony C. Hackney,Elsevier,2016-03-14,"A new volume in the Emerging Issues in Analytical Chemistry series, Exercise, Sport, and Bioanalytical Chemistry: Principles and Practice focuses on the basic and applied aspects of energy metabolism in humans. Concise and scientific, yet intelligible to the nonscientist, the book consists of two parts. Part I, Introduction: Basics and Background, provides the biochemistry necessary to understand the rest of the book and describes analytical processes and results as an aid to grasping the science. Part II, Applications: Knowledge into Practice, explores measurement techniques for metabolism, energy expenditure of various activities, techniques that enhance expenditure, metabolic adaptation, foods and drugs that enhance expenditure, and the role of bioanalytical chemistry in future research in exercise and sport. Discussion of the benefits of exercise and practices for improving the capacity to perform exercise is illustrated by many useful and entertaining examples. This volume allows readers to come away with a grasp of the scientific concepts, how they are manifested in research techniques, and how the results of research can be applied in the real world of public health and personal development.

How to Think About Exercise,Damon Young,Picador,2015-01-06,"USING PHILOSOPHY TO EXPLORE THE BIG IDEAS BEHIND FITNESS AND WAYS TO ENJOY EXERCISE WITHOUT LEAVING YOUR MIND BEHIND It can often seem as though existence is split in two: body and mind, flesh and spirit, moving and thinking. In the office or at study we are ‘mind workers,' with seemingly superfluous bodies. Conversely, in the gym we stretch, run and lift, but our minds are idle. In How to Think About Exercise, author and philosopher Damon Young challenges this idea of separation, revealing how fitness can develop our bodies and minds as one. Exploring exercises and sports with the help of ancient and modern philosophy, he uncovers the pleasures, virtues and big ideas of fitness. By learning how to exercise intelligently, we are contributing to our overall enjoyment of life and enhancing our full humanity. Find out how bestselling author Haruki Murakami quit smoking and took up running, and why the simple act radically changed his whole outlook on life; why Schopenhauer thought that swimming was a sublime act; how Charles Darwin came up with some of his best ideas while exercising; and much more. The School of Life is dedicated to exploring life's big questions: How can we fulfill our potential? Can work be inspiring? Why does community matter? Can relationships last a lifetime? We don't have all the answers, but we will direct you toward a variety of useful ideas—from philosophy to literature, from psychology to the visual arts—that are guaranteed to stimulate, provoke, nourish, and console.",1250059054,9781250059055,257,Self-Help,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=K2D2AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=K2D2AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Exercise&hl=&cd=407&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=K2D2AwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Motivation of Exercise and Physical Activity,Liam A. Chiang,Nova Publishers,2007,"In psychology, motivation refers to the initiation, direction, intensity and persistence of behaviour (Geen, 1995). Motivation is a temporal and dynamic state that should not be confused with personality or emotion. Motivation is having the desire and willingness to do something. A motivated person can be reaching for a long-term goal such as becoming a professional writer or a more short-term goal like learning how to spell a particular word. Personality invariably refers to more or less permanent characteristics of an individual's state of being (e.g., shy, extrovert, conscientious). As opposed to motivation, emotion refers to temporal states that do not immediately link to behaviour (e.g., anger, grief, happiness).",1600215963,9781600215964,0,Exercise,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=makPAwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=makPAwAACAAJ&dq=Exercise&hl=&cd=419&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=makPAwAACAAJ&dq=Exercise&hl=&source=gbs_api

We have tried to show in the preceding chapter how the brain and the psychical faculties can play an important part in bodily exercises. It remains for us to show here that muscular work may sometimes, on the contrary, be performed independently of the brain and without the intervention of the will. We must first recall the fact that the brain is not indispensable to the performance of certain movements. The spinal cord suffices in certain cases to throw the muscles into action, for it is a nerve-centre, and consequently a focus of independent motor activity. But the movements due to the unaided action of the spinal cord have a peculiar character: they are involuntary. The will in fact has a direct action only on the cells of the brain, and cannot influence the independent activity of the spinal cord. This latter is only...",1230371133,9781230371139,126,N/A,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AUcGngEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=AUcGngEACAAJ&dq=Exercise&hl=&cd=421&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=AUcGngEACAAJ&dq=Exercise&hl=&source=gbs_api
Advanced Neuromuscular Exercise Physiology,Phillip Gardiner,Human Kinetics,2024-03-26,"Advanced Neuromuscular Exercise Physiology, Second Edition, uses a mix of biochemistry, molecular biology, neurophysiology, and muscle physiology to provide a synthesis of knowledge and research in the field. The text is a leading resource devoted solely to the topic of nervous and neuromuscular systems, and it assists readers in identifying current directions in research and new avenues for exploration. Advanced Neuromuscular Exercise Physiology, Second Edition, offers readers a foundation of knowledge while detailing the most recent findings in the rapidly changing field of neuromuscular exercise physiology. It simplifies complex concepts with illustrations and graphs—including 20 new figures—all showcased in a new larger format to help students visualize and better understand the material. A new chapter on clinical considerations has been added, focusing on conditions that involve a compromise in the neuromuscular mechanisms necessary for movement. Other chapters have been updated with new or expanded content, including the following topics: Blood flow restriction during exercise as a training method The influence of pain on motor unit recruitment Surface EMG signals and the role that high-density surface EMG has played in motor unit recruitment research Updates on the role of the motoneuronal initial segment in the activation and adaptation of motoneurons An exploration of the “onion skin” pattern and neuromechanical matching for an explanation of motor unit recruitment The role of exerkines and small extracellular vesicles in adaptation to exercise The text covers a variety of important issues in the field, beginning with a discussion of motor unit types, muscle blood flow, and metabolic pathways in control of metabolism. Possible peripheral and central contributors to fatigue are discussed, as well as the effects of aerobic endurance training and strength training on the protein profiles of muscle fibers and on the central nervous system. Chapter objectives have been added to the text to provide a road map for the readers, and new review questions help students assess their understanding of the content. Chapter summaries recap the key issues presented for each topic. Analyses of research findings and research applications are highlighted in special sidebars. Throughout the text, practical examples help readers engage with the content. Within the dynamic field of neuromuscular exercise physiology, ideas of how nerves and muscles collaborate during acute and chronic exercise are continually evolving. Advanced Neuromuscular Exercise Physiology, Second Edition, offers an authoritative perspective of current research in the field as it seeks to encourage discussion, further study, and new research directions.",1718215576,9781718215573,353,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KCHLEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=KCHLEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Exercise&hl=&cd=422&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KCHLEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Eccentric Exercise,Hans Hoppeler,N/A,2016-05-22,"Eccentric muscle contraction, during which a muscle lengthens while under tension, is a fundamental process of human movement but a surprisingly under-researched area of exercise science. Evidence suggests that training programmes which incorporate both eccentric and concentric contractions can result in greater strength gains than concentric contractions alone, and this clearly has important implications for training and rehabilitation in sport and health. In Eccentric Exercise, leading international sport scientist Hans Hoppeler introduces the fundamental physiology and pathophysiology of eccentric muscle work, and explores the key applications of eccentric exercise in sport, rehabilitation and health. The book examines the molecular mechanisms responsible for tissue and organismic adaptations and discusses eccentric muscle-related pathology, specifically delayed onset muscle soreness. It assesses the use of eccentric exercise training in the treatment of certain disease states such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart insufficiency and sarcopenia, while a concluding chapter points to open research questions, shows the limits of the available data and highlights problems with current exercise modalities. This book is important reading for all sport and exercise scientists, clinicians working in rehabilitation, and high-level strength and conditioning coaches and trainers.",113869522X,9781138695221,0,Exercise,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=T97CjwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=T97CjwEACAAJ&dq=Exercise&hl=&cd=427&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=T97CjwEACAAJ&dq=Exercise&hl=&source=gbs_api
The Beginners Guide to Diet and Exercise,James Mazzola,N/A,2011-11-17,"Physical exercise is any bodily activity that enhances or maintains physical fitness and overall health and wellness. It is performed for various reasons including strengthening muscles and the cardiovascular system, honing athletic skills, weight loss or maintenance, as well as for the purpose of enjoyment. Frequent and regular physical exercise boosts the immune system, and helps prevent the ""diseases of affluence"" such as heart disease, cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes and obesity. It also improves mental health, helps prevent depression, helps to promote or maintain positive self esteem, and can even augment an individual's sex appeal or body image, which is also found to be linked with higher levels of self esteem. Childhood obesity is a growing global concern and physical exercise may help decrease the effects of childhood obesity in developed countries. Health care providers often call exercise the ""miracle"" or ""wonder"" drug - alluding to the wide variety of proven benefits that it provides.Physical exercise is important for maintaining physical fitness and can contribute positively to maintaining a healthy weight, building and maintaining healthy bone density, muscle strength, and joint mobility, promoting physiological well-being, reducing surgical risks, and strengthening the immune system.An effective exercise program needs to be fun and keep you motivated. It helps to have a goal.Your goal might be to:Manage a health conditionReduce stressImprove your staminaBuy clothes in a smaller sizeYour exercise program can also be a good way for you to socialize. Taking exercise classes or exercising with a friend are both good ways to be social.You may have a hard time starting an exercise routine, but once you do start, you will begin to notice other benefits:Better control of your weight and appetiteImproved fitness, making it easier to do everyday activitiesImproved sleepMore confidence in yourselfLower risk for heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure",1467958506,9781467958509,140,N/A,en,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=0xKZpwAACAAJ&dq=Exercise&hl=&cd=428&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=0xKZpwAACAAJ&dq=Exercise&hl=&source=gbs_api
The Joy of Movement,Kelly McGonigal,Penguin,2019-12-31,"The bestselling author of The Willpower Instinct introduces a surprising science-based book that doesn't tell us why we should exercise but instead shows us how to fall in love with movement. Exercise is health-enhancing and life-extending, yet many of us feel it's a chore. But, as Kelly McGonigal reveals, it doesn't have to be. Movement can and should be a source of joy. Through her trademark blend of science and storytelling, McGonigal draws on insights from neuroscience, psychology, anthropology, and evolutionary biology, as well as memoirs, ethnographies, and philosophers. She shows how movement is intertwined with some of the most basic human joys, including self-expression, social connection, and mastery--and why it is a powerful antidote to the modern epidemics of depression, anxiety, and loneliness. McGonigal tells the stories of people who have found fulfillment and belonging through running, walking, dancing, swimming, weightlifting, and more, with examples that span the globe, from Tanzania, where one of the last hunter-gatherer tribes on the planet live, to a dance class at Juilliard for people with Parkinson's disease, to the streets of London, where volunteers combine fitness and community service, to races in the remote wilderness, where athletes push the limits of what a human can endure. Along the way, McGonigal paints a portrait of human nature that highlights our capacity for hope, cooperation, and self-transcendence. The result is a revolutionary narrative that goes beyond familiar arguments in favor of exercise, to illustrate why movement is integral to both our happiness and our humanity. Readers will learn what they can do in their own lives and communities to harness the power of movement to create happiness, meaning, and connection.",0525534113,9780525534112,274,Health & Fitness,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5bSPDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,5,1,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=5bSPDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Exercise&hl=&cd=429&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5bSPDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api
Advances in Motivation in Sport & Exercise,Glyn C. Roberts,Human Kinetics Publishers,2001,"Much like its predecessor, Motivation in Sport and Exercise, Advances in Motivation in Sport and Exercisebrings together several top scholars in sport and exercise psychology to present the latest information on motivational behavior in exercise, physical education, and sport. Each contributor sheds new light on the process of motivation and the variables and constructs that help us to understand why we are motivated or are not motivated. This extensive resource thoroughly examines key motivational concepts such as -self-efficacy, -perceived competence, -achievement goals, -self-determination, and -perception of control. Although the contributors employ different frameworks to examine the subject, each uses a social cognitive perspective on motivation, which makes for a more cohesive book rather than just a collection of articles. The research provides valuable insight on enhancing motivation in physical activities. More important, it should inspire the reader to apply this insight in the gym, in the pool, and on the playing field, where it can truly make a difference in performance. Advances in Motivation in Sport and Exerciseis an excellent reference for professionals in both clinical and applied psychology, particularly those who work with athletes, coaches, teachers, and parents.",0880118490,9780880118491,446,Sports & Recreation,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=B6f2_1IlAHgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=B6f2_1IlAHgC&dq=Exercise&hl=&cd=430&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=B6f2_1IlAHgC&dq=Exercise&hl=&source=gbs_api

The Physiology of Exercise in Spinal Cord Injury,J. Andrew Taylor,Springer,2016-12-20,"Every year, around the world, between 250,000 and 500,000 people suffer a spinal cord injury (SCI). Those with an SCI are two to five times more likely to die prematurely than people without a spinal cord injury, with worse survival rates in low- and middle-income countries. Dynamic aerobic requires integrated physiologic responses across the musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, autonomic, pulmonary, thermoregulatory, and immunologic systems. Moreover, regular aerobic exercise beneficially impacts these same systems, reducing the risk for a range of diseases and maladies. This book will present comprehensive information on the unique physiologic effects of SCI and the potential role of exercise in treating and mitigating these effects. In addition, it will incorporate work from scientists across a number of disciplines and have contributors at multiple levels of investigation and across physiologic systems. Furthermore, SCI can be considered an accelerated form of aging due to the severely restricted physical inactivity imposed, usually at an early age. Therefore, the information presented may have a broader importance to the physiology of aging as it relates to inactivity. Lastly, the need for certain levels of regular aerobic exercise to engender adaptations beneficial to health is not altered by the burden of an SCI. Indeed, the amounts of exercise necessary may be even greater than the able-bodied due to ‘passive’ ambulation. This book will also address the potential health benefits for those with an SCI that can be realized if a sufficient exercise stimulus is provided.",1493966642,9781493966646,286,Medical,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uuzIDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=uuzIDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Exercise&hl=&cd=438&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uuzIDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Exercise Metabolism,N/A,N/A,2006,"Exercise Metabolism, Second Edition, provides a systematic, in-depth examination of the regulation of metabolic processes during exercise. Exercise physiologists, exercise biochemists, and biochemists will find this book a comprehensive reference, using the up-to-date information and the nearly 1,000 references in their own research and writing. In addition, graduate students in these disciplines can learn firsthand about the various regulations of metabolic processes during exercise as they prepare for careers in exercise physiology or biochemistry. Written by internationally recognized researchers, Exercise Metabolism, Second Edition, is both revised and expanded while retaining the essential elements of the first edition. It delves into the mobilization and utilization of substrates--glucose, lipid, and protein--during physical activity, and it explores metabolic factors in fatigue and metabolic adaptations to endurance training. Chapter 1 provides an overview of exercise metabolism. Metabolism during high-intensity exercise and the transition from rest to exercise are covered in chapter 2, which details the so-called anaerobic energy pathways. Chapter 3 discusses the effects of exercise on carbohydrate metabolism in skeletal muscle, while chapter 4 provides an overview of the important metabolic functions of the liver during exercise. Chapter 5 is a new chapter that addresses lactate transport in skeletal muscle, given the increased understanding of this topic since the first edition was published. Chapters 6 and 7 summarize the effects of exercise on lipolysis in adipose tissue and lipid metabolism in skeletal muscle, respectively. The contribution of protein and amino acids to exercise metabolism is discussed in chapter 8. Finally, metabolic factors in fatigue and the metabolic adaptations to endurance training are reviewed in chapters 9 and 10, respectively. Chapter-ending summaries help to condense the information and facilitate understanding. Exercise Metabolism, Second Edition, is a valuable reference to exercise physiologists, exercise biochemists, and biochemists, and it serves as an ideal text for graduate students in these disciplines.",1492596248,9781492596240,301,Energy metabolism,en,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=62sjzgEACAAJ&dq=Exercise&hl=&cd=440&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=62sjzgEACAAJ&dq=Exercise&hl=&source=gbs_api

Principles of Exercise Testing and Interpretation,"Karlman Wasserman, James E. Hansen, Kathy Sietsema, Darryl Y. Sue, William W Stringer, MD, Brian Whipp, Xing-Guo Sun, MD",Lww,2015-04-27,"""In this fifth edition of Principles of Exercise Testing and Interpretation, as in earlier editions, we attempt to develop conceptual advances in the physiology and pathophysiology of exercise, particularly as related to the practice of medicine. The underlying theme of the book continues to be the recognition that the most important requirement for exercise performance is transport of oxygen to support the bioenergetic processes in the muscle cells (including, of course, the heart) and elimination of the carbon dioxide formed as a byproduct of exercise metabolism. Thus, appropriate cardiovascular and ven- tilatory responses are required to match those of muscle respiration in meeting the energy demands of exercise. As depicted by the logo on the book cover, normal exercise performance requires an efficient coupling of external to internal (cellular) respiration. Appropriate treatment of exercise intolerance requires that patients' symptoms be thought of in terms of a gas exchange defect between the cell and the environment. The defect may be in the lungs, heart, peripheral or pulmonary circulations, the muscles themselves, or there may be a combination of defects. Thus, we describe the pathophysiology in gas transport and exchange that affect any site in the cardio- respiratory coupling between the lungs and the muscles. We illustrate how cardiopulmonary exercise testing can provide the means for a critical evaluation by the clinician-scientist of the functional competency of each component in the coupling of cellular to external respiration, including the cardiovascular system. To achieve this, clinical cases are used to illustrate the wide spectrum of pathophysiology capable of causing exercise intolerance""--Provided by publisher.",1469876914,9781469876917,588,Exercise tests,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Q1rZnQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=Q1rZnQAACAAJ&dq=Exercise&hl=&cd=444&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=Q1rZnQAACAAJ&dq=Exercise&hl=&source=gbs_api

The Hidden Mechanics of Exercise,Christopher M. Gillen,Belknap Press,2014-03-17,"As anyone who takes up a new sport quickly discovers, even basic athletic moves require high levels of coordination and control. Whether dribbling a basketball or hitting a backhand, limbs must be synchronized and bodies balanced, all with precise timing. But no matter how diligently we watch the pros or practice ourselves, the body's inner workings remain invisible. The Hidden Mechanics of Exercise reveals the microworld of the human body in motion, from the motor proteins that produce force, to the signaling molecules that activate muscles, to the enzymes that extract energy from nutrients. Christopher Gillen describes how biomolecules such as myosin, collagen, hemoglobin, and creatine kinase power our athletic movements. During exercise, these molecules dynamically morph into different shapes, causing muscles, tendons, blood, and other tissues to perform their vital functions. Gillen explores a wide array of topics, from how genetic testing may soon help athletes train more effectively, to how physiological differences between women and men influence nutrition. The Hidden Mechanics of Exercise tackles questions athletes routinely ask. What should we ingest before and during a race? How does a hard workout trigger changes in our muscles? Why does exercise make us feel good? Athletes need not become biologists to race in a triathlon or carve turns on a snowboard. But Gillen, who has run ten ultramarathons, points out that athletes wishing to improve their performance will profit from a deeper understanding of the body's molecular mechanisms.",0674724941,9780674724945,0,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3VjvnQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=3VjvnQEACAAJ&dq=Exercise&hl=&cd=447&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=3VjvnQEACAAJ&dq=Exercise&hl=&source=gbs_api

ACSM's Guide to Exercise and Cancer Survivorship,"American College of Sports Medicine, Melinda L. Irwin",Human Kinetics,2012-02-14,"ACSM’s Guide to Exercise and Cancer Survivorship presents the science behind the benefits of exercise for cancer survival and survivorship as well as the application of that science to the design or adaptation of exercise programs for cancer patients and survivors. Developed by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), this authoritative reference offers the most current information for health and fitness professionals working with survivors of many types of cancers. Dr. Melinda L. Irwin has assembled a team of the most respected experts in the field of exercise and cancer survivorship. With an emphasis on practical application, the text discusses the following: • Incidence and prevalence of the most common cancers • Common cancer treatments and side effects • Benefits of exercise after a diagnosis of cancer • Exercise testing, prescription, and programming • Nutrition and weight management • Counseling for health behavior change • Injury prevention • Program administration This guide presents evidence-based information to assist health, fitness, and medical professionals in using exercise to help cancer survivors with recovery, rehabilitation, and reducing the risk of recurrence. Throughout the text, readers will find quick-reference Take-Home Messages that highlight key information and how it can be applied in practice. Chapters also include reproducible forms and questionnaires to facilitate the implementation of an exercise program with a new client or patient, such as physician’s permission forms, medical and cancer treatment history forms, weekly logs of exercise and energy levels, medication listings, and nutrition and goal-setting questionnaires. In addition, ACSM’s Guide to Exercise and Cancer Survivorship discusses all of the job task analysis points tested in the ACSM/ACS Certified Cancer Exercise Trainer (CET) exam, making this the most complete resource available for health and fitness professionals studying to attain CET certification. Each chapter begins with a list of the CET exam points discussed in that chapter. A complete listing is also included in the appendix. As both an essential preparation text for certification and a practical reference, ACSM’s Guide to Exercise and Cancer Survivorship will increase health and fitness professionals’ knowledge of the benefits of exercise after a cancer diagnosis as well as the specifics of developing and adapting exercise programs to meet the unique needs of cancer survivors. Evidence has shown that physical activity has numerous health benefits for cancer patients and survivors. More clinicians and oncologists are recommending exercise as a strategy for reducing the side effects of treatment, speeding recovery, and improving overall quality of life. In turn, cancer survivors are seeking health and fitness professionals with knowledge and experience to help them learn how to exercise safely within their capabilities. With ACSM’s Guide to Exercise and Cancer Survivorship, health and fitness professionals can provide safe exercise programs to help cancer survivors improve their health, take proactive steps toward preventing recurrences, and enhance their quality of life.",1492581933,9781492581932,340,Health & Fitness,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DO96DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=DO96DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Exercise&hl=&cd=456&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DO96DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Handbook of Oxidants and Antioxidants in Exercise,"C. Sen, L. Packer, O. Hänninen",Elsevier,2000-02-16,"Interest in the science of exercise dates back to the time of ancient Greece. Today exercise is viewed not only as a leisurely activity but also as an effective preventive and therapeutic tool in medicine. Further biomedical studies in exercise physiology and biochemistry reports that strenuous physical exercise might cause oxidative lipid damage in various tissues. The generation of reactive oxygen species is elevated to a level that overwhelms the tissue antioxidant defense systems resulting in oxidative stress.The Handbook of Oxidants and Antioxidants in Exercise examines the different aspects of exercise-induced oxidative stress, its management, and how reactive oxygen may affect the functional capacity of various vital organs and tissues.

"Exercise, Energy Balance, and Cancer","Cornelia M. Ulrich, Karen Steindorf, Nathan A. Berger",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-10-11,"​​ While it is well established that the worldwide pandemic of overweight and obesity has profound effects on promoting cancer, it is now recognized that an alternative aspect of energy balance, namely physical activity and exercise have significant beneficial effects on all aspects of cancer across the spectrum from prevention through treatment and extending through survivorship. Moreover, salutary effects of physical activity and exercise extend across the age span from youth to old age and occur at all stages of cancer extending into palliative care. While the effect of physical activity and exercise on cancer may be partially mediated through obesity control, it is clear that considerable research is required and is ongoing at both the molecular and clinical levels to better understand the associated mechanisms and to develop optimal exercise strategies. This volume will contain chapters on the effect of exercise on biological pathways in tumor growth, state art exercise strategies and cutting edge research focused on different cancers and patient groups. It will provide an important volume in this series on energy balance and cancer and a basis for ongoing research, experimental approaches and application of evidence based practices to clinical care for patients with cancer.​",1461444926,9781461444923,240,Medical,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LsJKENVSgKYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=LsJKENVSgKYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Exercise&hl=&cd=476&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=LsJKENVSgKYC&dq=Exercise&hl=&source=gbs_api

Clinical Exercise Testing,"Paolo Palange, Pierantonio Laveneziana, J. Alberto Neder, Susan A. Ward",European Respiratory Society,2018-06-01,"In the last 10 years, the use of clinical exercise testing in respiratory medicine has grown significantly and, if used in the appropriate context, it has been demonstrated to provide clinically useful and relevant information. However, as its implementation and interpretation can be complicated, it should be used alongside previous medical evaluation (including medical history, physical examination and other appropriate complementary tests) and should be interpreted with the results of these additional tests in mind. This timely ERS Monograph aims to provide a comprehensive update on the contemporary uses of exercise testing to answer clinically relevant questions in respiratory medicine.

Exercise and Its Mediating Effects on Cognition,"Waneen Wyrick Spirduso, Leonard W. Poon, Wojtek J. Chodzko-Zajko",N/A,2008,"Current research is changing the notion that little can be done to deflect the inexorable damage done to the brain by the aging process. Exercise and Its Mediating Effects on Cognition shows that although many factors contribute to a healthy mind, an active lifestyle provides positive contributions to the cognitive functioning of the aging brain. Exercise and Its Mediating Effects on Cognitionexamines how physical activity can indirectly affect cognitive function by influencing mediators--such as sleep quality, nutrition, disease states, anxiety, and depression--that affect physical and mental resources for cognition. This volume also identifies and studies key sources of individual variations in exercise and cognitive processes. Seventeen internationally recognized experts in exercise, cognition, neurobiological processes, and aging provide a review of the state of knowledge and, where appropriate, provide practical applications of research findings. The book's review of research will update and expand current thinking on pertinent issues regarding the relationship between exercise and cognition. The research presented in Exercise and Its Mediating Effects on Cognition is organized within a general model that illustrates the interrelationships of exercise and physical activity and the mediators that enhance cognition. Each chapter begins with an overview of how the topic fits into the general model. Following each chapter, a summary provides not only the highlights of the chapter but also the consensus or controversies associated with the chapter topic. The first chapter outlines the exercise-cognition model developed by Spirduso, Poon, Chodzko-Zajko, and the text's contributors. Chapter 2 discusses exercise, mediators that affect physical and mental resources for cognition, and the combined relational effect on the cognitive process. Chapters 3 through 5 present research conducted on exercise and cognition in relation to depression, stress, and self-efficacy. Chapter 6 discusses cognitive energetics. Methodological problems of exercise and mental resources are presented in chapter 7; and diet, motor behavior, and cognition are discussed in chapter 8. Chapters 9 and 10 discuss the relationships between exercise, sleep, and cognition. The effects of exercise on cognition in cases of hypertension, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are presented in chapters 11 through 13. In the final chapter, the editors offer conclusions and future research directions. Exercise and Its Mediating Effects on Cognition is the second of a three-volume series in Human Kinetics' Aging, Exercise, and Cognition series, which presents advanced research and key issues for understanding and researching the links between exercise, aging, and cognition. In Exercise and Its Mediating Effects on Cognition, internationally known experts define current knowledge and future directions to address issues of active living, cognitive functioning, and aging. All three volumes are essential references for cognitive gerontologists, medical and health science researchers, exercise science researchers and professionals, and public health administrators interested in scientific evidence demonstrating the beneficial effects of regular physical activity on cognitive functioning and general health during the aging process.",1492597317,9781492597315,N/A,Cognition,en,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=VV2IzQEACAAJ&dq=Exercise&hl=&cd=485&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=VV2IzQEACAAJ&dq=Exercise&hl=&source=gbs_api

Exercise Testing and Training in Coronary Heart Disease,J.M.R. Detry,Springer,2011-11-15,"This study on ""Exercise testing and training in coronary heart disease"" is a remarkable compilation of numerous research studies, primarily from labora tories in Europe and the United States over the last decade or more. The topic reflects a growing awareness of and concern about the rapidly expanding understanding of the pathophysiology of coronary atherosclerotic heart disease. Since muscular exercise increases aerobic metabolism of myocardial and working skeletal muscles, greater flow of oxygenated blood is required by each; yet underlying vascular disease restricts these responses. This implicit paradox is here considered forthrightly. Examination of these relationships in symptomatic patients requires care and caution, because of the potential and occasionally real risks entailed. Accordingly, indirect assessment, particularly by noninvasive techniques, becomes increasingly important to detecting and monitoring - for the safety of the patients studied - the evidence of myocardial ischemia and impairment of left ventricular function under stress. Adequate assessment requires well-designed experimental studies to quantify true relationships and to measure the limits of functional capacity and the mechanisms of its impairment. Further more, alterations can be induced by therapy, whether this be pharmacological, medical or surgical, or achieved by physical reconditioning through exercise training. Not only is the cardiovascular system impaired by discrete and diffuse vascular lesions at central sites, but the degree of impairment is dynamic rather than static.",940102362X,9789401023627,88,Medical,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=B8CyswEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=B8CyswEACAAJ&dq=Exercise&hl=&cd=500&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=B8CyswEACAAJ&dq=Exercise&hl=&source=gbs_api

Sport and Exercise Nutrition,"Susan Lanham-New, Samantha Stear, Susan Shirreffs, Adam Collins",Wiley-Blackwell,2011-09-15,"Now widely adopted on courses throughout the world, the prestigious Nutrition Society Textbook series provides students with the scientific basics in nutrition in the context of a systems and disease approach rather than on a nutrient by nutrient basis. In addition books provide a means to enable teachers and students to explore the core principles of nutrition and to apply these throughout their training to foster critical thinking at all times. This NS Textbook on Sport and Exercise Nutrition has been written to cover the latest information on the science and practice of sport and exercise nutrition. A key concept behind this textbook is that it aims to combine the viewpoints of world leading nutrition experts from both academia/research and a practical stand point. Plus where necessary there are additional practitioner based authors to ensure theory is translated into practice for each chapter in the form of either ‘practice tips' or ‘information sheets' at the end of relevant chapters. The textbook in essence can be divided into three distinct but integrated parts: Part 1: covers the key components of the science that supports the practice of sport and exercise nutrition including comprehensive reviews on: nutrients both in general and as exercise fuels; exercise physiology; hydration, micronutrients; and supplements. Part 2: moves into focusing on specific nutrition strategies to support different types of training including: resistance; power/sprint; middle distance/speed endurance; endurance; technical/skill, team; and specific competition nutrition needs. The unique format of this textbook is that it breaks down nutrition support into training specific as opposed to the traditional sport specific support. This reflects the majority of current sport and exercise requirements of the need to undertake concurrent training and therefore facilitating targeted nutrition support to the different training components through the various macro and micro training cycles. Part 3: explores some of the practical issues encountered in working in the sport and exercise nutrition field and includes key sport related topics such as: disability sport; weight management; eating disorders; bone and gut health; immunity; injury; travel; and special populations and situations.

Beginning in primitive hunter-gatherer communities, where survival required adequate physical activity, it goes on to consider changes in health and physical activity at subsequent stages in the evolution of “civilization.” It focuses on the health impacts of a growing understanding of medicine and physiology, and the emergence of a middle-class with the time and money to choose between active and passive leisure pursuits. The book reflects on urbanization and industrialization in relation to the need for public health measures, and the ever-diminishing physical demands of the work-place. It then evaluates the attitudes of prelates, politicians, philosophers and teachers at each stage of the process. Finally, the book explores professional and governmental initiatives to increase public involvement in active leisure through various school, worksite, recreational and sports programmes.",3319383639,9783319383637,0,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=O_Y4vgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=O_Y4vgAACAAJ&dq=Exercise&hl=&cd=520&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=O_Y4vgAACAAJ&dq=Exercise&hl=&source=gbs_api

"The Objective Monitoring of Physical Activity: Contributions of Accelerometry to Epidemiology, Exercise Science and Rehabilitation","Roy J. Shephard, Catrine Tudor-Locke",Springer,2018-06-09,"This book examines the new knowledge that has been gained from the objective monitoring of habitual physical activity by means of pedometers and accelerometers. It reviews current advances in the technology of activity monitoring and details advantages of objective monitors relative to physical activity questionnaires. It points to continuing gaps in knowledge, and explores the potential for further advances in the design of objective monitoring devices. Epidemiologists have studied relationships between questionnaire assessments of habitual physical activity and various medical conditions for some seventy years. In general, they have observed positive associations between regular exercise and good health, but because of inherent limitations in the reliability and accuracy of physical activity questionnaires, optimal exercise recommendations for the prevention and treatment of disease have remained unclear. Inexpensive pedometers and accelerometers now offer the epidemiologist the potential to collect relatively precisely graded and objective information on the volume, intensity and patterns of effort that people are undertaking, to relate this data to past and future health experience, and to establish dose/response relationships between physical activity and the various components of health. Such information is important both in assessing the causal nature of the observed associations and in establishing evidence-based recommendations concerning the minimal levels of daily physical activity needed to maintain good health.",3319806041,9783319806044,383,Medical,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aeQwuAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=aeQwuAEACAAJ&dq=Exercise&hl=&cd=529&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=aeQwuAEACAAJ&dq=Exercise&hl=&source=gbs_api

Swimming with Dr Johnson and Mrs Thrale,Julia Allen,Lutterworth Press,2012-11-29,"""'Swimming with Dr Johnson and Mrs Thrale' challenges the popular image of Samuel Johnson as a man who favoured energetic discussion over physical exercise, enthroned in an armchair peering short-sightedly at a book. Thanks to the diarist and author Hester Thrale we have many anecdotes that connect Dr Johnson to a variety of sports, and Julia Allen, following Lytton Strachey's advice to attack her subject in unexpected places, uses entries from Dr Johnson's dictionary and anecdotes about the great man as her window into the world of eighteenth-century sport and exercise. Revealing a world both foreign and familiar, Allen takes the reader through a range of sports and activities, from boxing and cricket to dancing and coach travel to swimming, riding and skating. She reasserts women's place in eighteenth century sport, especially the luckier ones such as Mrs Thrale, and draws on medical treatises and reports to show how dangerous these sports could be, and to explore the theories upon which contemporary notions about health and exercise were based. Combined with fascinating biographies not only of Dr Johnson and Mrs Thrale, but also of a host of eighteenth-century sporting celebrities, Swimming with Dr Johnson and Mrs Thrale gives a fascinating insight into a century where things were done very differently, often with dangerous consequences. This eccentric book brings together pieces of eighteenth-century life to create a vivid picture of the whole, making it essential reading for anybody interested in history or sport.""",0718840984,9780718840983,314,Biography & Autobiography,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YdPYDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=YdPYDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Exercise&hl=&cd=559&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YdPYDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Following an introduction to the field, the text then shifts focus to personal factors that affect performance and psychological development in sport, physical education, and exercise settings. Situational factors that influence behavior, group interaction and processes, and the use of psychological techniques to help people perform more effectively are covered, as well as the roles psychological factors play in health and exercise. The final section deals with topics of psychological development and well-being that are important to both society and sport and exercise psychology, including children’s psychological development through sport participation, aggression in sport, and moral development and good sporting behavior in sport and physical activity contexts. The updated web study guide serves as an important learning tool to support the educational journey. With more than 100 engaging activities, it works directly with the text in guiding students to complete the related activities for each chapter and apply knowledge gained from the text. The study guide activities require students to do the following: • Use actual sport and exercise psychology instruments to assess their skills. • Determine how to respond to real-life scenarios (with short answers or essays). • Review research studies and experiments. • Search the Internet for relevant information. • Apply and test their understanding of principles and concepts of sport and exercise psychology. Many of the study guide activities offer compelling audio and video clips that provide an interactive look at how sport psychology consultants communicate with athletes and coaches to improve athletic experiences. These clips feature esteemed experts from the field discussing course concepts that they have studied and refined during their professional careers.

Fit Nation,Natalia Mehlman Petrzela,University of Chicago Press,2022-12-27,"How is it that Americans are more obsessed with exercise than ever, and yet also unhealthier? Fit Nation explains how we got here and imagines how we might create a more inclusive, stronger future. If a shared American creed still exists, it’s a belief that exercise is integral to a life well lived. A century ago, working out was the activity of a strange subculture, but today, it’s almost impossible to avoid exhortations to exercise: Walk 5K to cure cancer! Awaken your inner sex kitten at pole-dancing class! Sweat like (or even with) a celebrity in spin class! Exercise is everywhere. Yet the United States is hardly a “fit nation.” Only 20 percent of Americans work out consistently, over half of gym members don’t even use the facilities they pay for, and fewer than 30 percent of high school students get an hour of exercise a day. So how did fitness become both inescapable and inaccessible? Spanning more than a century of American history, Fit Nation answers these questions and more through original interviews, archival research, and a rich cultural narrative. As a leading political and intellectual historian and a certified fitness instructor, Natalia Mehlman Petrzela is uniquely qualified to confront the complex and far-reaching implications of how our contemporary exercise culture took shape. She explores the work of working out not just as consumers have experienced it, but as it was created by performers, physical educators, trainers, instructors, and many others. For Petrzela, fitness is a social justice issue. She argues that the fight for a more equitable exercise culture will be won only by revolutionizing fitness culture at its core, making it truly inclusive for all bodies in a way it has never been. Examining venues from the stage of the World’s Fair and Muscle Beach to fat farms, feminist health clinics, radical and evangelical college campuses, yoga retreats, gleaming health clubs, school gymnasiums, and many more, Fit Nation is a revealing history that shows fitness to be not just a matter of physical health but of what it means to be an American.",022665124X,9780226651248,460,Sports & Recreation,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iV6aEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=iV6aEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Exercise&hl=&cd=577&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iV6aEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api
Modelling and Simulation in Sport and Exercise,"Arnold Baca, Jürgen Perl",Routledge,2018-09-03,"Modelling and simulation techniques are of central importance to conducting research in sport and exercise science, informing data collection and helping to analyze patterns of movement and physical performance. Modelling and Simulation in Sport and Exercise is the first book to offer an instructive reference for modelling and simulation methods for researchers and sport and exercise scientists. Based around a series of research cases, describing core theories in applied, practical settings, the book draws on examples of modelling and simulation in ball games, biomechanical analysis, physiological testing and monitoring, predictive analysis and sports engineering and product design. Each research case presents a central problem, discusses different modelling approaches that could be used to deal with the issue, analysis of results and a reflection on the methodology and an exercise for students to put the techniques discussed into practice. This is an important reference for any active researcher or upper-level student in sport and exercise science with an interest in mathematical modelling, computer science or simulation techniques.",1315163292,9781315163291,276,Computers,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sy4wzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=sy4wzgEACAAJ&dq=Exercise&hl=&cd=578&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=sy4wzgEACAAJ&dq=Exercise&hl=&source=gbs_api
