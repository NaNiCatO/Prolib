Python in a Nutshell,Alex Martelli,"""O'Reilly Media, Inc.""",2006-07-14,"This book offers Python programmers one place to look when they needhelp remembering or deciphering the syntax of this open source languageand its many powerful but scantily documented modules. Thiscomprehensive reference guide makes it easy to look up the mostfrequently needed information--not just about the Python languageitself, but also the most frequently used parts of the standard libraryand the most important third-party extensions. Ask any Python aficionado and you'll hear that Python programmers haveit all: an elegant object-oriented language with readable andmaintainable syntax, that allows for easy integration with componentsin C, C++, Java, or C#, and an enormous collection of precoded standardlibrary and third-party extension modules. Moreover, Python is easy tolearn, yet powerful enough to take on the most ambitious programmingchallenges. But what Python programmers used to lack is a concise andclear reference resource, with the appropriate measure of guidance inhow best to use Python's great power. Python in aNutshell fills this need. Python in a Nutshell, Second Edition covers morethan the language itself; it also deals with the mostfrequently used parts of the standard library, and the most popular andimportant third party extensions. Revised and expanded forPython 2.5, this book now contains the gory details of Python's newsubprocess module and breaking news about Microsoft's newIronPython project. Our ""Nutshell"" format fits Python perfectly bypresenting the highlights of the most important modules and functionsin its standard library, which cover over 90% of your practicalprogramming needs. This book includes: A fast-paced tutorial on the syntax of the Python language An explanation of object-oriented programming in Python Coverage of iterators, generators, exceptions, modules,packages, strings, and regular expressions A quick reference for Python's built-in types and functionsand key modules Reference material on important third-party extensions,such as Numeric and Tkinter Information about extending and embedding Python Python in a Nutshell provides a solid,no-nonsense quick reference to information that programmers rely on themost. This book will immediately earn its place in any Pythonprogrammer's library. Praise for the First Edition: ""In a nutshell, Python in a Nutshell serves oneprimary goal: to act as an immediately accessible goal for the Pythonlanguage. True, you can get most of the same core information that ispresented within the covers of this volume online, but this willinvariably be broken into multiple files, and in all likelihood lackingthe examples or the exact syntax description necessary to trulyunderstand a command."" --Richard Cobbett, Linux Format ""O'Reilly has several good books, of which Python in aNutshell by Alex Martelli is probably the best for giving yousome idea of what Python is about and how to do useful things with it."" --Jerry Pournelle, Byte Magazine",1449379109,9781449379100,738,Computers,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JnR9hQA3SncC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,3.5,8,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=JnR9hQA3SncC&pg=PA80&dq=python&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=JnR9hQA3SncC&dq=python&hl=&source=gbs_api

Python,Chris Fehily,Peachpit Press,2002,"Named after the Monty Python comedy troupe, Python is an interpreted, open-source, object-oriented programming language. It's also free and runs portably on Windows, Mac OS, Unix, and other operating systems. Python can be used for all manner of programming tasks, from CGI scripts to full-fledged applications. It is gaining popularity among programmers in part because it is easier to read (and hence, debug) than most other programming languages, and it's generally simpler to install, learn, and use. Its line structure forces consistent indentation. Its syntax and semantics make it suitable for simple scripts and large programs. Its flexible data structures and dynamic typing allow you to get a lot done in a few lines. To learn it, you'll need is some basic programming experience and a copy of Python: Visual QuickStart Guide. In patented Visual QuickStart Guide fashion, the book doesn't just tell you how to use Python to develop applications, it shows you, breaking Python into easy-to-digest, step-by-step tasks and providing example code. Python: Visual QuickStart Guide emphasizes the core language and libraries, which are the building blocks for programs. Author Chris Fehily starts with the basics - expressions, statements, numbers, strings - then moves on to lists, dictionaries, functions, and modules before wrapping things up with straightforward discussions of exceptions and classes. Some additional topics covered include: - Object-oriented programming- Working in multiple operating systems- Structuring large programs- Comparing Python to C, Perl, and Java- Handling errors gracefully.",0201748843,9780201748840,444,Computers,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=carqdIdfVlYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,3,2,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=carqdIdfVlYC&pg=PA376&dq=python&hl=&cd=18&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=carqdIdfVlYC&dq=python&hl=&source=gbs_api

Foundations of Python Network Programming,"John Goerzen, Tim Bower, Brandon Rhodes",Apress,2011-02-24,"This second edition of Foundations of Python Network Programming targets Python 2.5 through Python 2.7, the most popular production versions of the language. Python has made great strides since Apress released the first edition of this book back in the days of Python 2.3. The advances required new chapters to be written from the ground up, and others to be extensively revised. You will learn fundamentals like IP, TCP, DNS and SSL by using working Python programs; you will also be able to familiarize yourself with infrastructure components like memcached and message queues. You can also delve into network server designs, and compare threaded approaches with asynchronous event-based solutions. But the biggest change is this edition's expanded treatment of the web. The HTTP protocol is covered in extensive detail, with each feature accompanied by sample Python code. You can use your HTTP protocol expertise by studying an entire chapter on screen scraping and you can then test lxml and BeautifulSoup against a real-world web site. The chapter on web application programming now covers both the WSGI standard for component interoperability, as well as modern web frameworks like Django. Finally, all of the old favorites from the first edition are back: E-mail protocols like SMTP, POP, and IMAP get full treatment, as does XML-RPC. You can still learn how to code Python network programs using the Telnet and FTP protocols, but you are likely to appreciate the power of more modern alternatives like the paramiko SSH2 library.

This book is ideal for readers with some Python programming experience. The book covers key language concepts that must be understood to program effectively, especially for data analysis applications. Certain low-level language features are discussed in detail, especially Python memory management and data structures. Using Python effectively means taking advantage of its vast ecosystem. The book discusses Python package management and how to use third-party modules as well as how to structure your own Python modules. The section on object-oriented programming explains features of the language that facilitate common programming patterns. After developing the key Python language features, the book moves on to third-party modules that are foundational for effective data analysis, starting with Numpy. The book develops key Numpy concepts and discusses internal Numpy array data structures and memory usage. Then, the author moves onto Pandas and details its many features for data processing and alignment. Because strong visualizations are important for communicating data analysis, key modules such as Matplotlib are developed in detail, along with web-based options such as Bokeh, Holoviews, Altair, and Plotly. The text is sprinkled with many tricks-of-the-trade that help avoid common pitfalls. The author explains the internal logic embodied in the Python language so that readers can get into the Python mindset and make better design choices in their codes, which is especially helpful for newcomers to both Python and data analysis.

Python Programming and Visualization for Scientists,Alex Joseph DeCaria,N/A,2016-05-01,"Python has rapidly become a dominant language in the scientific community for analyzing and visualizing data, in part due to its concise, intuitive syntax and free availability without the purchase of an expensive license. The syntax of the language itself is easy to pick up, but learning how to plot and visualize data has required more effort in the past, since the relevant resources are spread across the Internet. Hence, the idea for this book. Specifically, the author wrote it from the perspective of ""What book would I want to have had when I was transitioning to Python?""This book will be useful not only as a classroom text but also as a guide and reference for students, educators, and researchers who have some programming experience already and want to start creating plots and analyzing data using Python. It is not meant for the person who is completely new to programming, nor is it an introductory computer science textbook. The author's assumption is that the reader has some experience programming, though not necessarily with Python.Although the new Python programmer may wish to read the book cover-to-cover, the book is organized such that the experienced Python programmer who wants to get started in plotting data can readily jump to the appropriate chapter. The last few chapters include topics that are more advanced, such as using regular expressions for matching text patterns, performing spectral analysis of data, or solving systems of linear equations.",0972903372,9780972903370,270,N/A,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=snDOjgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=snDOjgEACAAJ&dq=python&hl=&cd=97&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=snDOjgEACAAJ&dq=python&hl=&source=gbs_api

Financial Modelling in Python,"Shayne Fletcher, Christopher Gardner",John Wiley & Sons,2010-10-28,"""Fletcher and Gardner have created a comprehensive resource that will be of interest not only to those working in the field of finance, but also to those using numerical methods in other fields such as engineering, physics, and actuarial mathematics. By showing how to combine the high-level elegance, accessibility, and flexibility of Python, with the low-level computational efficiency of C++, in the context of interesting financial modeling problems, they have provided an implementation template which will be useful to others seeking to jointly optimize the use of computational and human resources. They document all the necessary technical details required in order to make external numerical libraries available from within Python, and they contribute a useful library of their own, which will significantly reduce the start-up costs involved in building financial models. This book is a must read for all those with a need to apply numerical methods in the valuation of financial claims."" –David Louton, Professor of Finance, Bryant University This book is directed at both industry practitioners and students interested in designing a pricing and risk management framework for financial derivatives using the Python programming language. It is a practical book complete with working, tested code that guides the reader through the process of building a flexible, extensible pricing framework in Python. The pricing frameworks' loosely coupled fundamental components have been designed to facilitate the quick development of new models. Concrete applications to real-world pricing problems are also provided. Topics are introduced gradually, each building on the last. They include basic mathematical algorithms, common algorithms from numerical analysis, trade, market and event data model representations, lattice and simulation based pricing, and model development. The mathematics presented is kept simple and to the point. The book also provides a host of information on practical technical topics such as C++/Python hybrid development (embedding and extending) and techniques for integrating Python based programs with Microsoft Excel.",0470747897,9780470747896,244,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2XQM7QiTqw4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=2XQM7QiTqw4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=python&hl=&cd=132&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2XQM7QiTqw4C&source=gbs_api

Understanding Optics with Python,"Vasudevan Lakshminarayanan, Hassen Ghalila, Ahmed Ammar, L. Srinivasa Varadharajan",CRC Press,2018-02-19,"Optics is an enabling science that forms a basis for our technological civilization. Courses in optics are a required part of the engineering or physics undergraduate curriculum in many universities worldwide. The aim of Understanding Optics with Python is twofold: first, to describe certain basic ideas of classical physical and geometric optics; second, to introduce the reader to computer simulations of physical phenomena. The text is aimed more broadly for those who wish to use numerical/computational modeling as an educational tool that promotes interactive teaching (and learning). In addition, it offers an alternative to developing countries where the necessary equipment to carry out the appropriate experiments is not available as a result of financial constraints. This approach contributes to a better diffusion of knowledge about optics. The examples given in this book are comparable to those found in standard textbooks on optics and are suitable for self-study. This text enables the user to study and understand optics using hands-on simulations with Python. Python is our programming language of choice because of its open-source availability, extensive functionality, and an enormous online support. Essentials of programming in Python 3.x, including graphical user interface, are also provided. The codes in the book are available for download on the book’s website. Discusses most standard topics of traditional physical and geometrical optics through Python and PyQt5 Provides visualizations and in-depth descriptions of Python’s programming language and simulations Includes simulated laboratories where students are provided a ""hands-on"" exploration of Python software Coding and programming featured within the text are available for download on the book’s corresponding website. ""Understanding Optics with Python by Vasudevan Lakshminarayanan, Hassen Ghalila, Ahmed Ammar, and L. Srinivasa Varadharajan is born around a nice idea: using simulations to provide the students with a powerful tool to understand and master optical phenomena. The choice of the Python language is perfectly matched with the overall goal of the book, as the Python language provides a completely free and easy-to-learn platform with huge cross-platform compatibility, where the reader of the book can conduct his or her own numerical experiments to learn faster and better."" — Costantino De Angelis, University of Brescia, Italy ""Teaching an important programming language like Python through concrete examples from optics is a natural and, in my view, very effective approach. I believe that this book will be used by students and appreciated greatly by instructors. The topic of modelling optical effects and systems where the students should already have a physical background provides great motivation for students to learn the basics of a powerful programming language without the intimidation factor that often goes with a formal computer science course."" — John Dudley, FEMTO-ST Institute, Besançon, France",1351648845,9781351648844,342,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BtNMDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=BtNMDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=python&hl=&cd=153&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=BtNMDwAAQBAJ&dq=python&hl=&source=gbs_api

Advanced Python Development,Matthew Wilkes,Apress,2020-08-09,"This book builds on basic Python tutorials to explain various Python language features that aren’t routinely covered: from reusable console scripts that play double duty as micro-services by leveraging entry points, to using asyncio efficiently to collate data from a large number of sources. Along the way, it covers type-hint based linting, low-overhead testing and other automated quality checking to demonstrate a robust real-world development process. Some powerful aspects of Python are often documented with contrived examples that explain the feature as a standalone example only. By following the design and build of a real-world application example from prototype to production quality you'll see not only how the various pieces of functionality work but how they integrate as part of the larger system design process. In addition, you'll benefit from the kind of useful asides and library recommendations that are a staple of conference Q&A sessions at Python conferences as well as discussions of modern Python best practice and techniques to better produce clear code that is easily maintainable. Advanced Python Development is intended for developers who can already write simple programs in Python and want to understand when it’s appropriate to use new and advanced language features and to do so in a confident manner. It is especially of use to developers looking to progress to a more senior level and to very experienced developers who have thus far used older versions of Python.

Effective Python Development for Biologists,Martin Jones,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,2016-09-26,"Python is rapidly becoming the standard language for many talks in scientific research, and is particularly popular in biology and bioinformatics. One of the great strengths of Python is the ecosystem of tools and libraries that have grown up around it. This book introduces the novice biologist programmer to tools and techniques that make developing Python code easier and faster and will help you to write more reliable, performant programs. Written by a biologist, it focusses on solving the problems that students and researchers encounter every day: How do I make my program run faster? How can I be sure that my results are correct? How do I share this program with my colleagues? How can I speed up the process of writing my code? Chapters include: Environments for development - learn how you can take advantage of different tools for actually writing code, including those designed specifically for scientific work. Organising and sharing code - learn how Python's module and packaging system works, how to effectively reuse code across multiple projects, and how to share your programs with colleagues and the wider world. Testing - learn how automated testing can make your code more reliable, how to catch bugs before they impact your work, and how to edit code with confidence. Performance - learn how to make your code run quickly even on large datasets, how to understand the scaling behaviour of your code, and explore the trade offs involved in designing code. User interfaces - learn how to make your code more user friendly, how to design effective interfaces, and how to automate record-keeping with Python's logging system. About the author Martin started his programming career by learning Perl during the course of his PhD in evolutionary biology, and started teaching other people to program soon after. Since then he has taught introductory programming to hundreds of biologists, from undergraduates to PIs, and has maintained a philosophy that programming courses must be friendly, approachable, and practical. In his academic career, Martin mixed research and teaching at the University of Edinburgh, culminating in a two year stint as Lecturer in Bioinformatics. He now runs programming courses for biological researchers as a full time freelancer. Praise for Martin's previous books ""Great, great book. I think this is the perfect book for any biologist to who wants to start learning to code with Python... I didn't know a command-line from a hole in the ground when I first opened up this book, and mere days later I was impressing my colleagues with my own DNA analysis programs."" ""Zero to writing useful programs in a weekend... Python for Biologists arrived last Thursday, 6/16/16, I spent the whole weekend glued to my laptop in a 2 1/2 day frenzy of coding, and I just finished it -- and came on Amazon to order the next one!""

The built-in tkinter GUI framework was limited, but with the latest versions of Python 3 and tkinter, all of this has dramatically changed.This book will guide you from the very basics of creating a fully functional GUI in Python with only a few lines of code. Each and every recipe adds more widgets to the GUIs we are creating. While the cookbook recipes all stand on their own, there is a common theme running through all of them. As our GUIs keep expanding, using more and more widgets, we start to talk to networks, databases, and graphical libraries that greatly enhance our GUI's functionality.",1787129454,9781787129450,322,N/A,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4vZCMQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,5,1,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=4vZCMQAACAAJ&dq=python&hl=&cd=282&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=4vZCMQAACAAJ&dq=python&hl=&source=gbs_api
