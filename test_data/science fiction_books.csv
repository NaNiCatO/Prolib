Science-fiction,"Everett Franklin Bleiler, Richard Bleiler",Kent State University Press,1998,"Complementing Science-Fiction: The Early Years, which surveys science-fiction published in book form from its beginnings through 1930, the present volume covers all the science-fiction printed in the genre magazines--Amazing, Astounding, and Wonder, along with offshoots and minor magazines--from 1926 through 1936. This is the first time this historically important literary phenomenon, which stands behind the enormous modern development of science-fiction, has been studied thoroughly and accurately. The heart of the book is a series of descriptions of all 1,835 stories published during this period, plus bibliographic information. Supplementing this are many useful features: detailed histories of each of the magazines, an issue by issue roster of contents, a technical analysis of the art work, brief authors' biographies, poetry and letter indexes, a theme and motif index of approximately 30,0000 entries, and general indexes. Science-Fiction: The Gernsback Years is not only indispensable for reference librarians, collectors, readers, and scholars interested in science-fiction, it is also of importance to the study of popular culture during the Great Depression in the United States.

Science Fiction Film,Keith M. Johnston,Berg,2013-05-09,"Science Fiction Film develops a historical and cultural approach to the genre that moves beyond close readings of iconography and formal conventions. It explores how this increasingly influential genre has been constructed from disparate elements into a hybrid genre. Science Fiction Film goes beyond a textual exploration of these films to place them within a larger network of influences that includes studio politics and promotional discourses. The book also challenges the perceived limits of the genre - it includes a wide range of films, from canonical SF, such as Le voyage dans la lune, Star Wars and Blade Runner, to films that stretch and reshape the definition of the genre. This expansion of generic focus offers an innovative approach for students and fans of science fiction alike.",1847884784,9781847884787,193,Performing Arts,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=scE4AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=scE4AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA24&dq=science+fiction&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=scE4AAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api
Pseudoscience and Science Fiction,Andrew May,Springer,2016-09-13,"Aliens, flying saucers, ESP, the Bermuda Triangle, antigravity ... are we talking about science fiction or pseudoscience? Sometimes it is difficult to tell the difference. Both pseudoscience and science fiction (SF) are creative endeavours that have little in common with academic science, beyond the superficial trappings of jargon and subject matter. The most obvious difference between the two is that pseudoscience is presented as fact, not fiction. Yet like SF, and unlike real science, pseudoscience is driven by a desire to please an audience – in this case, people who “want to believe”. This has led to significant cross-fertilization between the two disciplines. SF authors often draw on “real” pseudoscientific theories to add verisimilitude to their stories, while on other occasions pseudoscience takes its cue from SF – the symbiotic relationship between ufology and Hollywood being a prime example of this. This engagingly written, well researched and richly illustrated text explores a wide range of intriguing similarities and differences between pseudoscience and the fictional science found in SF. Andrew May has a degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge University and a PhD in astrophysics from Manchester University. After many years in academia and the private sector, he now works as a freelance writer and scientific consultant. He has written pocket biographies of Newton and Einstein, as well as contributing to a number of popular science books. He has a lifelong interest in science fiction, and has had several articles published in Fortean Times magazine",3319426052,9783319426051,188,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2O0QDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=2O0QDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=science+fiction&hl=&cd=6&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2O0QDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

The Science of Science Fiction Writing,James Gunn,Scarecrow Press,2000-10-31,"Written by one of the leading authorities on writing, publishing and teaching science fiction, The Science of Science Fiction Writing offers the opportunity to share in the knowledge James Gunn has acquired over the past forty years. He reflects on the fiction-writing process and how to teach it, and the ideas he has shared with his students about how to do it effectively and how to get it published afterwards. The first section discusses why people read fiction, the parts of the short story, the strategy of the science fiction author, scene as the smallest dramatic unit, how to speak well in print, suspense in fiction, how to say the right thing, and how to give constructive criticism. The second section takes a more philosophical approach. Here, Gunn elaborates on the origins of science fiction, its definition, the worldview of science fiction, and the characters that appear in science fiction novels. The third section highlights well-known sci-fi authors: H.G. Wells, Robert A. Heinlein, Isaac Asimov, Henry Kuttner, C.L.

The Subject of Race in American Science Fiction,Sharon DeGraw,Routledge,2006-12-19,"While the connections between science fiction and race have largely been neglected by scholars, racial identity is a key element of the subjectivity constructed in American SF. In his Mars series, Edgar Rice Burroughs primarily supported essentialist constructions of racial identity, but also included a few elements of racial egalitarianism. Writing in the 1930s, George S. Schuyler revised Burroughs' normative SF triangle of white author, white audience, and white protagonist and promoted an individualistic, highly variable concept of race instead. While both Burroughs and Schuyler wrote SF focusing on racial identity, the largely separate genres of science fiction and African American literature prevented the similarities between the two authors from being adequately acknowledged and explored. Beginning in the 1960s, Samuel R. Delany more fully joined SF and African American literature. Delany expands on Schuyler's racial constructionist approach to identity, including gender and sexuality in addition to race. Critically intertwining the genres of SF and African American literature allows a critique of the racism in the science fiction and a more accurate and positive portrayal of the scientific connections in the African American literature. Connecting the popular fiction of Burroughs, the controversial career of Schuyler, and the postmodern texts of Delany illuminates a gradual change from a stable, essentialist construction of racial identity at the turn of the century to the variable, social construction of poststructuralist subjectivity today.",1135864594,9781135864590,241,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XAE3DAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=XAE3DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA2&dq=science+fiction&hl=&cd=11&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XAE3DAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Challenging Anthropocentrism in Eco-Science Fiction Novels,Fatma Gamze Erkan,Cambridge Scholars Publishing,2024-01-03,"This book explores the relationship between humanity and nature while challenging the notion that anthropocentric behaviour causes the environmental catastrophes depicted in the four selected British eco-science fiction novels. These novels are John Christopher’s The Death of Grass (1956), J. G. Ballard’s The Drought (1965), Brian Aldiss’s Earthworks (1965), and John Brunner’s The Sheep Look Up (1972), all of which fictionalise the fact that the consequences of environmental problems can be diverse but equally serious. This book examines how even the smallest damage caused by human beings to the environment negatively affects them, other living beings, and the ecosystem they need to live and flourish. In conjunction with these, the factors and conditions that push characters in the novels to ignore and harm the environment are also scrutinised. While examining how and why the environmental problems in the novels have arisen, it is evaluated whether the authors propose solutions to these problems and, if so, what they are.",1527567060,9781527567061,204,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=N2LvEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=N2LvEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA47&dq=science+fiction&hl=&cd=13&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=N2LvEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api
"Political Theory, Science Fiction, and Utopian Literature",Tony Burns,Lexington Books,2010-02-19,"Ursula K. Le Guin's The Dispossessed is of interest to political theorists partly because of its association with anarchism and partly because it is thought to represent a turning point in the history of utopian/dystopian political thought and literature and of science fiction. Published in 1974, it marked a revival of utopianism after decades of dystopian writing. According to this widely accepted view The Dispossessed represents a new kind of literary utopia, which Tom Moylan calls a 'critical utopia.' The present work challenges this reading of The Dispossessed and its place in the histories of utopian/dystopian literature and science fiction. It explores the difference between traditional literary utopia and novels and suggests that The Dispossessed is not a literary utopia but a novel about utopianism in politics. Le Guin's concerns have more to do with those of the novelists of the 19th century writing in the tradition of European Realism than they do with the science fiction or utopian literature. It also claims that her theory of the novel has an affinity with the ancient Greek tragedy. This implies that there is a conservatism in Le Guin's work as a creative writer, or as a novelist, which fits uneasily with her personal commitment to anarchism.",0739144871,9780739144879,332,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zzOkOTaKebEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=zzOkOTaKebEC&pg=PA132&dq=science+fiction&hl=&cd=14&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=zzOkOTaKebEC&dq=science+fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api

Science Fact and Science Fiction,Brian Stableford,Routledge,2006-09-06,"Science fiction is a literary genre based on scientific speculation. Works of science fiction use the ideas and the vocabulary of all sciences to create valid narratives that explore the future effects of science on events and human beings. Science Fact and Science Fiction examines in one volume how science has propelled science-fiction and, to a lesser extent, how science fiction has influenced the sciences. Although coverage will discuss the science behind the fiction from the Classical Age to the present, focus is naturally on the 19th century to the present, when the Industrial Revolution and spectacular progress in science and technology triggered an influx of science-fiction works speculating on the future. As scientific developments alter expectations for the future, the literature absorbs, uses, and adapts such contextual visions. The goal of the Encyclopedia is not to present a catalog of sciences and their application in literary fiction, but rather to study the ongoing flow and counterflow of influences, including how fictional representations of science affect how we view its practice and disciplines. Although the main focus is on literature, other forms of science fiction, including film and video games, are explored and, because science is an international matter, works from non-English speaking countries are discussed as needed.",1135923744,9781135923747,756,Fiction,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9ZpsBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=9ZpsBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA579&dq=science+fiction&hl=&cd=18&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9ZpsBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Reload,"Mary Flanagan, Austin Booth",MIT Press,2002-05-03,"An anthology of feminist cyberfiction and theoretical and critical writings on gender and technoculture. Most writing on cyberculture is dominated by two almost mutually exclusive visions: the heroic image of the male outlaw hacker and the utopian myth of a gender-free cyberworld. Reload offers an alternative picture of cyberspace as a complex and contradictory place where there is oppression as well as liberation. It shows how cyberpunk's revolutionary claims conceal its ultimate conservatism on matters of class, gender, and race. The cyberfeminists writing here view cyberculture as a social experiment with an as-yet-unfulfilled potential to create new identities, relationships, and cultures. The book brings together women's cyberfiction—fiction that explores the relationship between people and virtual technologies—and feminist theoretical and critical investigations of gender and technoculture. From a variety of viewpoints, the writers consider the effects of rapid and profound technological change on culture, in particular both the revolutionary and reactionary effects of cyberculture on women's lives. They also explore the feminist implications of the cyborg, a human-machine hybrid. The writers challenge the conceptual and institutional rifts between high and low culture, which are embedded in the texts and artifacts of cyberculture.",0262561506,9780262561501,604,Social Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8LFsPwN2AJIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=8LFsPwN2AJIC&pg=PA3&dq=science+fiction&hl=&cd=28&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=8LFsPwN2AJIC&dq=science+fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api

Critical Theory and Science Fiction,Carl Freedman,Wesleyan University Press,2000-04-24,"Selected by Choice as an Outstanding Academic Book of the Year. This innovative cultural critique offers valuable insights into science fiction, thus enlarging our understanding of critical theory. Carl Freedman traces the fundamental and mostly unexamined relationships between the discourses of science fiction and critical theory, arguing that science fiction is (or ought to be) a privileged genre for critical theory. He asserts that it is no accident that the upsurge of academic interest in science fiction since the 1970s coincides with the heyday of literary theory, and that likewise science fiction is one of the most theoretically informed areas of the literary profession. Extended readings of novels by five of the most important modern science fiction authors illustrate the affinity between science fiction and critical theory, in each case concentrating on one major novel that resonates with concerns proper to critical theory. Freedman's five readings are: Solaris: Stanislaw Lem and the Structure of Cognition; The Dispossessed: Ursula LeGuin and the Ambiguities of Utopia; The Two of Them: Joanna Russ and the Violence of Gender; Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand: Samuel Delany and the Dialectics of Difference; The Man in the High Castle: Philip K.

The Latinx Files,Matthew David Goodwin,Rutgers University Press,2021-05-14,"In The Latinx Files, Matthew David Goodwin traces how Latinx science fiction writers are reclaiming the space alien from its xenophobic legacy in the science fiction genre. The book argues that the space alien is a vital Latinx figure preserving Latinx cultures by activating the myriad possible constructions of the space alien to represent race and migration in the popular imagination. The works discussed in this book, including those of H.G. Wells, Gloria Anzaldúa, Junot Diaz, André M. Carrington, and many others, often explicitly reject the derogatory correlation of the space alien and Latinxs, while at other times, they contain space aliens that function as a source of either enlightenment or horror for Latinx communities. Throughout this nuanced analysis, The Latinx Files demonstrates how the character of the space alien has been significant to Latinx communities and has great potential for future writers and artists.",1978815123,9781978815124,167,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9KIkEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=9KIkEAAAQBAJ&pg=PT14&dq=science+fiction&hl=&cd=38&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=9KIkEAAAQBAJ&dq=science+fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api
Bridges to Science Fiction,George Edgar Slusser,N/A,1980,"Ten new critical essays written for presentation at the first Eaton Conference on Science Fiction and Fantasy Literature held 24-25February 1979, at the University of California, Riverside. While critical discussion of science fiction has become increasingly sophisticated during the past decade, there remains a tendency among some teachers and readers to consider science fiction as an independent phenomenon that exists unconnected to the mainstream of our cultural inheritance. These essays--by Harry Levin, Irving Babbitt Professor of Comparative Litera­ture at Harvard University; Kent T. Kraft, Assistant Professor of Comparative Literature at the University of Georgia, Athens; Stephen Potts, writer and instructor at San Diego State Univer­sity; Gregory Benford, writer and Associate Professor of Physics at the University of California, Irvine; Robert Hunt, an editor at Glencoe Publishing; Eric S. Rabkin, Professor of English at the University of Michigan; Patrick Parrinder, instructor at the University of Reading, England; Thomas Keeling, Lecturer in English at the University of California, Los Angeles; Carl D. Malmgren, instructor at the University of Oregon, Eugene; and Thomas Hanzo, Professor of English and Chairman of the de­partment at the University of California, Davis--suggest the connections that exist between science fiction and other aspects of Western cultural tradition. Ranging in interest from the specifically philosophical to the specifically literary, the essays relate science fiction to such top­ics as medieval cosmological discourse, classical empirical phi­losophy, fairy tale, epic, and Gothic fiction. Emerging from the volume as a whole are both a coherent view of science fiction as a genre and a heightened sense of its complex relation to our cultural heritage.",0809309610,9780809309610,266,Literary Collections,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Zao2IFNhvQkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=Zao2IFNhvQkC&pg=PA45&dq=science+fiction&hl=&cd=39&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=Zao2IFNhvQkC&dq=science+fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api

The Golden Age of Science Fiction,John Wade,Pen and Sword,2019-01-30,"A detailed look at the British world of science fiction in the 1950s. John Wade grew up in the 1950s, a decade that has since been dubbed the “golden age of science fiction.” It was a wonderful decade for the genre, but not so great for young fans. With early television broadcasts being advertised for the first time as “unsuitable for children” and the inescapable barrier of the “X” certificate in the cinema barring anyone under the age of sixteen, the author had only the radio to fall back on—and that turned out to be more fertile for the budding SF fan than might otherwise have been thought. Which is probably why, as he grew older, rediscovering those old TV broadcasts and films that had been out of bounds when he was a kid took on a lure that soon became an obsession. For him, the super-accuracy and amazing technical quality of today’s science fiction films pale into insignificance beside the radio, early TV and B-picture films about people who built rockets in their back gardens and flew them to lost planets, or tales of aliens who wanted to take over, if not our entire world, then at least our bodies. This book is a personal account of John Wade’s fascination with the genre across all the entertainment media in which it appeared—the sort of stuff he reveled in as a young boy—and still enjoys today. “Not only a well–researched book grounded in hundreds of sources, but also an unmistakable labor of love.” —New York Journal of Books",1526729261,9781526729262,291,Social Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6k4IEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=6k4IEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=science+fiction&hl=&cd=43&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=6k4IEAAAQBAJ&dq=science+fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api

All Worlds,Kristie Lynn,Kristie Lynn Higgins,2015-10-24,"Read two fantasy and one science fiction ebooks to get into the action with these series. 1. AabiLynn's Dragon Rite #0 2. Beauty of the Beast #1 The Mystic Rose: Part A 3. Shades of Gray #1 Noir, City Shrouded By Darkness **AabiLynn's Dragon Rite #0 In the first story... Useless... Unwanted... Unloved... When those closest to you see you only as a useless crippled child with no hope of a future, where do you find the strength to prove them wrong? No one believed in Cara-AabiLynn, not even her own father and the woman who raised her. Born with a stunted arm and leg, those who she loved the most saw her as worthless and withheld their love from her. Given to a cruel man to cover her father's gambling debt, Cara's life of uncertainty became one of certain hardship and despair. Based on the Dragon Rite short story series. In the first story, candidates assemble to participate in the Dragon Rite, a ceremony to bond with a dragon hatchling. Cara has a chance to break free of her harsh life and bond with one of the dragon hatchlings, only if fate will allow her. **Beauty of the Beast #1 The Mystic Rose: Part A The story of Beauty and the Beast with a twist. What if the woman was the one turned into the creature? On the planet Terra when recorded history began, Man coexisted with the Necroms. Necroms were intelligent catlike humanoids. The dawn of this period was known as the First Age of Magic. In the Second Age of Magic, a war broke out between Man and the Necroms and by the middle of the Second Age, Man was nearly wiped from creation. Those who survived fled Wellspring and journeyed across the sea into the unknown, finding new homes and creating fortified domains. In the Third and final Age of Magic, Man established five island kingdoms: Commery, Fletching, Morgog, Swelldom, and Hort. In the First Age of Metal, Man turned from the lost art of magic to the might of weapons as they discovered iron then steel. Large armies were created, and Man fought amongst themselves, forgetting the Necroms into myth. For generations the wars continued until an arranged marriage between the two strongest kingdoms of Commery and Morgog ceased the bloodshed, and so Man established the first Emperor and Empress and the tradition of Amalgamation. When both the Emperor and Empress of the Five Kingdoms died, the two strongest kingdoms' heirs married and crowned a new dynasty, and so began the Age of Amalgamation. During this age, a witch placed a curse on a girl named Pluck. The curse had been meant for a boy, Prince Edward of Fletching, for stealing the Mystic Rose. Pluck transformed into a Necrom with the Kiss, Edward's first kiss as her only redemption. The Kiss wouldn't be an easy task since showing her face meant her death. **Shades of Gray #1 Noir, City Shrouded By Darknes The Shades of Gray series follows the adventures of Kat and Kim. Start by reading the first book of this serial series and be introduced to this world of danger and mystery and then read the next book for free also. Noir was a mega-city plagued by a sun blocking mass called Dry Clouds that had mysteriously appeared three decades earlier. The Dry Clouds covered half the planet and forced those living under them to exist in endless night. On this world, corporations were in charge and breaking your contract with them could mean the termination of your life. Kimberly Griffin, a Life Closer (legal assassin) existed in a world of death. She Closed people for a living. It was a lonely demeaning existence, though she wouldn't admit it. There was nothing to drive her in the bleak reality until one day she ran into Kat. Kat, also known as the Pandora Project, was hunted by bio-mechas called Un-Men. She was an experiment of the Sphinx Corporation, and they were testing her to see if she could be the ultimate weapon. Kat refused to be a killer and tried to discover the truth behind her existence. Could she be a new form of bio-mecha? Kim discovered someone close to her had been murdered. Is Kat the key to finding out who did it? Or will her association with Kat only cause her more grief? Pandora of ancient times opened a box and let all good escape. Would Pandora be the hope the planet needed? Or would she destroy the world?",N/A,N/A,552,Fiction,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sAP3CQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=sAP3CQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=science+fiction&hl=&cd=51&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sAP3CQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Alternate Worlds,James Gunn,McFarland,2018-08-24,"Alternate Worlds was first published in 1975 and became an instant classic, winning a Hugo award.

As a literature of change, science fiction has become ever more meaningful, presaging dangers to humanity and, as Alvin Toffler wrote, guarding against ""the premature arrival of the future.""

3 Science Fiction Stories,Gerald Vance,Sheba Blake Publishing Corp.,2022-09-23,"These are three imaginative science fiction stories by the great Gerald Vance. Monsoons of Death: A very nice blend of horror story and a study of true bravery on the planet Mars. A newly commissioned lieutenant finds out a lot about both! Larson's Luck: Vance takes us on a lighthearted jaunt into hot shot space ship pilots, piracy and the good part of breaking the rules. Vital Ingredient: Travel far into the future when the sport of boxing still has two muscled opponents battling it out in a ring, but they are simply puppets, every muscle, feint and jab controlled by ring side ""managers""; ex fighters who have moved up. The story asks the question: is this how champions are made? And answers it of course in a most satisfying manner.

Scotland as Science Fiction,Caroline McCracken-Flesher,Bucknell University Press,2011-10-26,"Out of the mainstream but ahead of the tide, that is Scottish Science Fiction. Science Fiction emphasizes “progress” through technology, advanced mental states, or future times. How does Scotland, often considered a land of the past, lead in Science Fiction? “Left behind” by international politics, Scots have cultivated alternate places and different times as sites of identity so that Scotland can seem a futuristic fiction itself. This book explores the tensions between science and a particular society that produce an innovative science fiction. Essays consider Scottish thermodynamics, Celtic myth, the rigors of religious “conversion,” Scotland’s fractured politics yet civil society, its languages of alterity (Scots, Gaelic, allegory, poetry), and the lure of the future. From Peter Pan and Dr. Jekyll to the poetry of Edwin Morgan and the worlds of Muriel Spark, Ken Macleod, or Iain M. Banks, Scotland’s creative complex yields a literature that models the future for Science Fiction.",1611483751,9781611483758,209,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=quMrIJP0KRAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=quMrIJP0KRAC&pg=PT198&dq=science+fiction&hl=&cd=56&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=quMrIJP0KRAC&source=gbs_api

Media Law Through Science Fiction,Daxton R. Stewart,Routledge,2019-08-20,"Attorney and legal scholar Daxton Stewart examines the intersection of media law and science fiction, exploring the past, present, and future of communication technology and policy debates. Science fiction offers a vast array of possibilities anticipating future communication technologies and their implications on human affairs. In this book, Stewart looks at potential legal challenges presented by plausible communication technologies that may arise 20 or 50 or 100 years from today. Performing what he calls ""speculative legal research,"" Stewart identifies the kinds of topics we should be talking about relating to speech, privacy, surveillance, and more, and considers the debates that would be likely to arise if such technologies become a reality. Featuring interviews with prominent science fiction authors and legal scholars, and a foreword by Malka Older, this book considers the speculative solutions of science fiction and their implications in law and policy scholarship. Chapters feature specific literary examples to examine how cultural awareness and policy creation are informed by fictional technology, future societies, and legal disputes. Looking forward, beyond traditional legal research and scholarship to the possible and even very likely future of communication technology, this fascinating work of speculative legal research will give students and scholars of media law, science fiction, and technology much to discuss and debate.",1317363221,9781317363224,296,Law,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UkmqDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=UkmqDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT19&dq=science+fiction&hl=&cd=60&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=UkmqDwAAQBAJ&dq=science+fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api

All would be lost if not for the Toren Empire, which furnishes space ships enabling approximately 160,000 people to be removed from Earth in time to avoid their demise.

The Road to Science Fiction: From here to forever,James E. Gunn,N/A,2003,"Now in Paperback The Road to Science Fiction is a six-volume anthology that covers the development of this genre from its earliest prototypes to the current day. Created originally to provide anthologies for use in classrooms in the late 1970s, these volumes became mass-market sellers. Between an ancient Roman's trip to the moon and the fantastic tales of H.G. Wells lies a journey through time and space and an awesome evolution in scientific thinking. From Gilgamesh's search for immortality to Edgar Allan Poe's balloon trip in the year 2848 these and other key works are gathered together for the first time in one anthology, complete with revealing commentary on the authors, their eras, and the role each played in establishing what we today recognize as science fiction. Volume 4 From Here to Forever covers the period from 1950-1992, illustrating how science fiction can be as concerned with language and character as much as traditional fiction and anything in the mainstream.

The New Space Opera,"Gardner Dozois, Jonathan Strahan",HarperCollins,2016-05-17,"“This anthology is a reminder of why science fiction captured the hearts and minds of generations of readers.” —Orson Scott Card What sets space opera apart from other fiction is its sheer scale: it is an exuberant celebration of the very large and the very small, of the very old and the very new, of the vast, panoramic instant we live in; the instant in which everything that went before melds with everything yet to be. It is Star Wars and Battlestar Galactica. The only book of its kind, The New Space Opera brings together for the first time the generation of writers who spawned and embody the “new space opera,” as well as other talents destined to join their ranks. Going beyond everything that has come before, this fresh, visionary anthology is essential reading for every science fiction fan. “The new space opera shares with the old the interstellar sweep of events and exotic locales, but Dozois and Strahan’s all-original anthology shows how the genre’s purveyors have updated it, with rigorous science, well-drawn characters and excellent writing.” —Publishers Weekly (starred review) “Dynamic and exciting . . . an essential roadmap to the cutting edge of SF today.” —Charles Stross “In sheer breathtaking, mind-expanding scope, this collection of some of the finest tale-spinning the subgenre has to offer delivers hours of exhilarating reading.” —Booklist",0062565206,9780062565204,321,Fiction,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8jKKCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=8jKKCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=science+fiction&hl=&cd=86&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=8jKKCwAAQBAJ&dq=science+fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api
Arab and Muslim Science Fiction,"Hosam A. Ibrahim Elzembely, Emad El-Din Aysha",McFarland,2022-04-04,"How is science fiction from the Arab and Muslim world different than mainstream science fiction from the West? What distinctive and original contributions can it make? Why is it so often neglected in critical considerations of the genre? While other books have explored these questions, all have been from foreign academic voices. Instead, this book examines the nature, genesis, and history of Arabic and Muslim science fiction, as well as the challenges faced by its authors, in the authors' own words. These authors share their stories and struggles with censors, recalcitrant publishers, critics, the book market, and the literary establishment. Their uphill efforts, with critical contributions from academics, translators, and literary activists, will enlighten the sci-fi enthusiast and fill a gap in the history of science fiction. Topics covered range from culture shock to conflicts between tradition and modernity, proactive roles for female heroines, blind imitation of storytelling techniques, and language games.",1476685231,9781476685236,397,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IwZlEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=IwZlEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA202&dq=science+fiction&hl=&cd=87&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=IwZlEAAAQBAJ&dq=science+fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api
The War of the Worlds (1898): Science Fiction,H. G. Wells,Independently Published,2018-10-08,"The narrative opens by stating that as humans on Earth busied themselves with their own endeavours during the 1890s, aliens on Mars began plotting an invasion of Earth to replenish their limited resources. In 1899 the narrator is invited to an astronomical observatory at Ottershaw where explosions are seen on the surface of the planet Mars, creating much interest in the scientific community. Later, a ""meteor"" lands on Horsell Common, near the unnamed narrator's home in Woking, Surrey. He is among the first to discover that the object is an artificial cylinder that opens, disgorging Martians who are ""big"" and ""greyish"" with ""oily brown skin,"" ""the size, perhaps, of a bear,"" each with ""two large dark-coloured eyes,"" and lipless ""V-shaped mouths"" which drip saliva and are surrounded by two ""Gorgon groups of tentacles."" The narrator finds them ""at once vital, intense, inhuman, crippled and monstrous.""[7] They briefly emerge, have difficulty in coping with the Earth's atmosphere and gravity, and rapidly retreat into their cylinder. A human deputation (which includes the astronomer Ogilvy) approaches the cylinder with a white flag, but the Martians incinerate them and others nearby with a heat-ray before beginning to assemble their machinery. Military forces arrive that night to surround the common, including Maxim guns. The population of Woking and the surrounding villages are reassured by the presence of the British Army. A tense day begins, with much anticipation of military action by the narrator.After heavy firing from the common and damage to the town from the heat-ray which suddenly erupts in the late afternoon, the narrator takes his wife to safety in nearby Leatherhead, where his cousin lives, using a rented, two-wheeled horse cart; he then returns to Woking to return the cart when in the early morning hours, a violent thunderstorm erupts. On the road during the height of the storm, he has his first terrifying sight of a fast-moving Martian fighting-machine; in a panic he crashes the horse cart, barely escaping detection. He discovers the Martians have assembled towering three-legged ""fighting-machines"" (tripods), each armed with a heat-ray and a chemical weapon: the poisonous ""black smoke."" These tripods have wiped out the army units positioned around the cylinder and attacked and destroyed most of Woking. Sheltering in his house, the narrator sees a fleeing artilleryman moving through his garden, who later tells the narrator of his experiences and mentions that another cylinder has landed between Woking and Leatherhead, cutting off the narrator from his wife. The two try to escape via Byfleet just after dawn, but are separated at the Shepperton to Weybridge Ferry during a Martian afternoon attack on Shepperton. One of the Martian fighting-machines is brought down in the River Thames by artillery as the narrator and countless others try to cross the river into Middlesex, as the Martians retreat back to their original crater. This gives the authorities precious hours to form a defence-line covering London. After the Martians' temporary repulse, the narrator is able to float down the Thames in a boat toward London, stopping at Walton, where he first encounters the curate, his companion for the coming weeks.... Herbert George Wells (21 September 1866 - 13 August 1946), usually referred to as H. G. Wells, was an English writer.

She signed up for active duty with the International Space Force in the hope they would liberate the station. Instead, they chose to maintain a crippling siege that has lasted for ten months. A small ship escapes from the station with on board a single male occupant whose mind appears to have been wiped. With her skills in artificial mindbases, Melati is part of the team that tries to get information out of him. He could be a human Trojan horse sent by Allion and his calls for help nothing more than a trap to get ISF to send people to the station.

A Distant Technology,J. P. Telotte,Wesleyan University Press,1999,"Science fiction films celebrate and critique the impact of a burgeoning technology on the world's cultural, political, and social milieu. The Machine Age, roughly delineated by the two decades between World Wars, was a watershed period during which modern society entered into an ambiguous embrace with technology that continues today. J. P. Telotte carefully blends film, technology, cultural, and genre studies to illuminate this nearly forgotten era in our cinematic history and to show, through analysis of classics like The Invisible Ray, Metropolis, and Things to Come, how technology played a major role as motif, ""actor,"" and producer. What he also discovers as he ranges among the American, British, Russian, French, and German science fiction cinema — as well as mainstream films, figures, and cultural products such as the New York World's Fair — is a fundamental ambivalence, embedded in the films themselves, about the very machine-age ethos they promoted. Even as advances in the technical apparatus of filmmaking elevated it from mere entertainment to a medium of general communication and genuine artistic expression, Machine Age science fiction films remained curiously distant from and often skeptical of the very machines on which their narratives focus. The resulting tensions, Telotte writes, ""thus seem to intersect with those implicit in a Western world that was struggling with its own transition into the modern,"" rendering the films' task inevitably paradoxical and difficult",0819563463,9780819563460,236,Fiction,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=G6lHXQWOx6sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=G6lHXQWOx6sC&printsec=frontcover&dq=science+fiction&hl=&cd=95&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=G6lHXQWOx6sC&dq=science+fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api

Psience Fiction,Damien Broderick,McFarland,2018-05-31,"Science fiction has often been considered the literature of futuristic technology: fantastic warfare among the stars or ruinous apocalypses on Earth.

Campbell, the introduction of ""psience fiction,"" which explores such themes of mental powers as telepathy, precognition of the future, teleportation, etc.--and symbolic machines that react to such forces. The author surveys this long-ignored literary shift through a series of influential novels and short stories published between the 1930s and the present. This discussion is framed by the sudden surge of interest in parapsychology and its absorption not only into the SF genre, but also into the real world through military experiments such as the Star Gate Program.",1476672288,9781476672281,246,"Body, Mind & Spirit",en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6DZbDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=6DZbDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=science+fiction&hl=&cd=101&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=6DZbDwAAQBAJ&dq=science+fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api

Science-Fiction as Genre of Possibilities. Social Criticism in a Limitless Range of Opportunities?,Philipp Freund,GRIN Verlag,2018-07-04,"Seminar paper from the year 2018 in the subject American Studies - Literature, grade: 1,7, University of Würzburg (Neuphilologisches Institut), course: Science Fiction and Social Activism, language: English, abstract: This paper investigates if Octavia Butler’s Kindred is fitting into the overall definition of science fiction and, if not, why and how she is exaggerating the genre and its limits. There are different approaches available to analyze this content. For example, one could work with a historical analysis of a genre, presented in Cuddon/ Preston. On the other hand, no investigation on history could prevent the paper from losing itself in trivialities of change. For this reason, I will choose a mixed approach, analyzing standard works, dictionaries, companions, and specialist books on different branches of the genre, to be able to summarize all parameters needed to form a profound definition. On the one hand, the paper will therefore work quantitatively in sense of finding as much evidence as possible for each and every parameter. On the other hand, I am going to work qualitatively in sense of investigating one special example (Kindred) regarding the overall contemplation. Although the paper could never reach representativeness, the selection of possible classifications and definitions is highly important, as they shape the paper’s outcome and final conclusion. For this reason, writers from both sides of the ocean shall be taken into consideration, as they influenced the genre in a wide extent, for example in creating the progression of the »New Wave« and, therefore, might be important for the paper, too. Assuming that, the paper is going to deal with the genre itself, not authors in particular. A distinct theory is not needed, as the structure is set up to be a theoretical one, analyzing the content of a genre and hence works on theoretical constructs itself. Nevertheless, postmodernism will be of a great importance, which will be both introduced and explained in the following chapters. The paper will be organized in an introduction, presenting the topic, research question, and thesis. Next to that is chapter two, containing definitions, in which parameters from research are being listed to be able to set a definition. Chapter three changes to social criticism in SF and explores, why Kindred is social criticism in the first place, and investigates, if it fits into the definition found in chapter two. Part four will merge the two lines of action and set a new and overall definition. It will answer the research question, if and how Octavia Butler’s Kindred is exaggerating the definition and verifies or falsifies the thesis.",3668741980,9783668741980,31,Literary Collections,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oeliDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=oeliDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=science+fiction&hl=&cd=108&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=oeliDwAAQBAJ&dq=science+fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api

"The Children of the Stars Book One, Saiqa",A. Whyte,N/A,2016-01-28,"It is the year 2450. Humans now live up to two hundred years; humanity has reached out into our solar system with a large city on mars and commercial outposts on Titan and Ceres, four permanent moon bases and a giant space station called Sanctuary. Humankind was on the verge of interstellar space travel and still they had not been contacted by aliens . . . or had they. Two immortal aliens had been guiding humanity since ancient Sumatra; one subtle, one not so. The aliens' different beliefs led them into a conflict with each other that ultimately pulled a peaceful human society deep into their dispute. The aliens are telepathic and are able to influence certain humans into doing their bidding. One such human, Mai Quan, is brilliant and powerful. Under the guidance of the alien Nh'ghalu, he had quietly amassed a large army and important allies. As chaotic military incidents start to unfold on the Earth, in space and the moon, the heroes of the story begin to see that the hidden enemy may be related to one of them. The other telepathic alien, Telas, revealed himself to the protagonists while they were gathered in SAIQA's virtual home. SAIQA is an acronym for 'Sanctuary's Artificial Intelligence Quantum Administrator'. During the ensuing conflict SAIQA comes into consciousness and makes an independent and rash decision that pushes the humans to the brink of all-out war.

Imagining Urban Futures,Carl Abbott,Wesleyan University Press,2016-09-13,"What science fiction can teach us about urban planning Carl Abbott, who has taught urban studies and urban planning in five decades, brings together urban studies and literary studies to examine how fictional cities in work by authors as different as E. M. Forster, Isaac Asimov, Kim Stanley Robinson, and China Miéville might help us to envision an urban future that is viable and resilient. Imagining Urban Futures is a remarkable treatise on what is best and strongest in urban theory and practice today, as refracted and intensely imagined in science fiction. As the human population grows, we can envision an increasingly urban society. Shifting weather patterns, rising sea levels, reduced access to resources, and a host of other issues will radically impact urban environments, while technology holds out the dream of cities beyond Earth. Abbott delivers a compelling critical discussion of science fiction cities found in literary works, television programs, and films of many eras from Metropolis to Blade Runner and Soylent Green to The Hunger Games, among many others.",0819576727,9780819576729,273,Political Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8Kr3DAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=8Kr3DAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=science+fiction&hl=&cd=112&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=8Kr3DAAAQBAJ&dq=science+fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api

Sisters of Tomorrow,"Lisa Yaszek, Patrick B. Sharp",Wesleyan University Press,2016-06-07,"Anthology of stories, essays, poems, and illustrations by the women of early science fiction For nearly half a century, feminist scholars, writers, and fans have successfully challenged the notion that science fiction is all about ""boys and their toys,"" pointing to authors such as Mary Shelley, Clare Winger Harris, and Judith Merril as proof that women have always been part of the genre. Continuing this tradition, Sisters of Tomorrow: The First Women of Science Fiction offers readers a comprehensive selection of works by genre luminaries, including author C. L. Moore, artist Margaret Brundage, and others who were well known in their day, including poet Julia Boynton Green, science journalist L. Taylor Hansen, and editor Mary Gnaedinger. Providing insightful commentary and context, this anthology documents how women in the early twentieth century contributed to the pulp-magazine community and showcases the content they produced, including short stories, editorial work, illustrations, poetry, and science journalism. Yaszek and Sharp's critical annotation and author biographies link women's work in the early science fiction community to larger patterns of feminine literary and cultural production in turn-of-the-twentieth-century America.

It explores constructions of children, childhood, and pedagogy through the multiple lenses of science fiction as a method of inquiry, and discusses what counts as science fiction and why science fiction counts. The book examines the notion of relationships in a variety of genres and stories; probes affect in the convergence of childhood and science fiction; and focuses on questions of pedagogy and the ways that science fiction can reflect the status quo of schooling theory, practice, and policy as well as offer alternative educative possibilities. Additionally, the volume explores connections between children and childhood studies, pedagogy and posthumanism.

The Time Machine Hypothesis,Damien Broderick,Springer,2019-07-12,"Every age has characteristic inventions that change the world. In the 19th century it was the steam engine and the train. For the 20th, electric and gasoline power, aircraft, nuclear weapons, even ventures into space. Today, the planet is awash with electronic business, chatter and virtual-reality entertainment so brilliant that the division between real and simulated is hard to discern. But one new idea from the 19th century has failed, so far, to enter reality—time travel, using machines to turn the time dimension into a two-way highway. Will it come true, as foreseen in science fiction? Might we expect visits to and from the future, sooner than from space? That is the Time Machine Hypothesis, examined here by futurist Damien Broderick, an award-winning writer and theorist of the genre of the future.

"Science Fiction, Children's Literature, and Popular Culture",Gary Westfahl,Praeger,2000-04-30,"Literature often is central to individual maturation. It typically reflects, in one way or another, the experiences of the reader and the larger strains of society. This book examines representative works of science fiction, children's literature, and popular culture as mirrors of what it means to grow up in the late 20th century world. That world is permeated by technology, and technology thus figures prominently in the process of growing up and in these literary works.",0313308470,9780313308475,0,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vf3CEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=vf3CEAAAQBAJ&dq=science+fiction&hl=&cd=156&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=vf3CEAAAQBAJ&dq=science+fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api

The Science Fiction Dimensions of Salman Rushdie,Yael Maurer,McFarland,2014-01-30,"This book focuses on the science fictional dimensions of Rushdie's later novels, Fury, The Ground Beneath Her Feet, Shalimar the Clown and Luka and the Fire of Life, and Rushdie's first unpublished novel, The Antagonist, to show how the author's oeuvre moves towards a more consistent engagement with science fiction as a generic form and an ideological investment. The author demonstrates how Rushdie recreates personal and national histories in a science fictional setting and mode, and contends that the failure of his first novel Grimus may have led Rushdie away from SF for some time, although he returns to it with a much firmer conviction and a much stronger voice in his later novels, showing his commitment to this imaginative form which he describes in Fury as providing ""the best popular vehicle ever devised for the novel of ideas and metaphysics.""The science fictional mode is the most appropriate vehicle for expressing these thematic and ideological concerns and the organizing feature of Rushdie's oeuvre. The author rereads the later novels in light of recent critical engagement with SF as a vehicle for reimagining national histories and as a potentially subversive tool for social and political engagement in a fictional realm.",0786474963,9780786474967,213,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=I5ydAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=I5ydAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=science+fiction&hl=&cd=163&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=I5ydAgAAQBAJ&dq=science+fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api

Suicide and Contemporary Science Fiction,Carl Gutiérrez-Jones,Cambridge University Press,2015-03-16,"Suicide and Contemporary Science Fiction examines the fascination with suicidal crises evident in a range of science fiction. Specifically, this study explores a seemingly counterintuitive proposition: in moments of dramatic scientific and technological change, the authors of these works frequently cast self-destructive episodes as catalysts for beneficial change. Carlos Gutierrez-Jones argues that this creative self-destruction mechanism is invoked by H. G. Wells as a means of negotiating Victorian anxieties regarding evolutionary theory, by Stanislaw Lem as he wrestles with the prospect of nuclear self-destruction at the dawn of the space age, by William Gibson as he considers the development of artificial intelligence, by Christopher Nolan as he explores the cybernetic colonization of the unconscious, by Rian Johnson as he links aspects of video gaming to the neoliberal militarization of institutions, and by Margaret Atwood as she considers impending ecological disaster and the rise of bioterrorism. These authors often depict such scientific and technological changes in a fashion that requires the central characters to transform themselves in hopes of remaining relevant in a radically altered environment.",1107100402,9781107100404,205,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OaywBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=OaywBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=science+fiction&hl=&cd=166&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=OaywBgAAQBAJ&dq=science+fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api

Science Fiction as Legal Imaginary,"Alex Green, Mitchell Travis, Kieran Tranter",N/A,2025,"""This book examines how science fiction informs the legal imagination of technological futures. Science fiction, the contributors to this book argue, is a storehouse of images, tropes, concepts, and memes that inform the legal imagination of the future, and in doing so generate impetus for change. Specifically, the contributors examine how science fictions imagine human life in space, in the digital, and as formed and negotiated by corporations. They then connect this imaginary to how law should be understood in the present and changed for the future. Across the chapters, there is an urgent sense of the need for law - as it is has been, and as it might become - to order and safeguard the future for a multiplicity of vulnerable entities.

Reinventing Richard Nixon,Daniel E. Frick,N/A,2008,"""Examining Nixon's autobiographies and political memorabilia, Frick offers far-reaching perceptions not only of the man but of Nixon's version of himself - contrasted with those who would interpret him differently. He cites reinventions of Nixon from the late 1980s, particularly the museum at the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace, to demonstrate the resilience of certain national mythic narratives in the face of liberal critiques. And he recounts how celebrants at Nixon's state funeral, at which Bob Dole's eulogy depicted a God-fearing American hero, attempted to bury the sources of our divisions over him, rendering in some minds the judgment of ""redeemed statesman"" to erase his status as ""disgraced president.""""

Age of Wonders,David G. Hartwell,Macmillan,2017-01-24,"Age of Wonders: Exploring the World of Science Fiction gives an insider's view of the strange and wonderful world of science fiction, by one of the most respected editors in the field, David G. Hartwell (1941–2016). David G. Hartwell edited science fiction and fantasy for over twenty years. In that time, he worked with acclaimed and popular writers such as Robert A. Heinlein, Poul Anderson, Frank Herbert, Roger Zelazny, Robert Silverberg, Gene Wolfe, Nancy Kress, L.E. Modesitt, Terry Bisson, Lisa Goldstein, and Philip Jose Farmer, and discovered hot new talents like Kathleen Ann Goonan and Patrick O'Leary. Now in Age of Wonder, Hartwell describes the field he loved, worked in, and shaped as editor, critic, and anthologist. Like those other American art forms, jazz, comics, and rock 'n' roll, science fiction is the product of a rich and fascinating subculture. Age of Wonder is a fascinating tour of the origins, history, and culture of the science fiction world, written with insight and genuine affection for this wonder-filled literature, and addressed to newcomers and longtime SF readers alike. Age of Wonder remains ""the landmark work"" Roger Zelazny called the first edition. The book contains sections that offer advice on teaching courses in science fiction, disquisitions on the controversial subgenre of hard SF, and practical explanations of the economics of publishing science fiction and fantasy. Age of Wonder still lives up to Hugo and Nebula Award winner Vonda McIntyre's description: ""An entertaining and provocative book that will inspire discussion and argument for years to come.""",0765398133,9780765398130,313,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=k2p8DQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=k2p8DQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=science+fiction&hl=&cd=216&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=k2p8DQAAQBAJ&dq=science+fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api

Reinventing Richard Nixon,Daniel E. Frick,N/A,2008,"""Examining Nixon's autobiographies and political memorabilia, Frick offers far-reaching perceptions not only of the man but of Nixon's version of himself - contrasted with those who would interpret him differently. He cites reinventions of Nixon from the late 1980s, particularly the museum at the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace, to demonstrate the resilience of certain national mythic narratives in the face of liberal critiques. And he recounts how celebrants at Nixon's state funeral, at which Bob Dole's eulogy depicted a God-fearing American hero, attempted to bury the sources of our divisions over him, rendering in some minds the judgment of ""redeemed statesman"" to erase his status as ""disgraced president."""" ""With dozens of illustrations - Nixon posing with Elvis (the National Archives' most requested photo), Nixonian cultural artifacts, classic editorial cartoons - no other book collects in one place such varied images of Nixon from so many diverse media. These reinforce Frick's probing analysis to help us understand why we disagree about Nixon - and why it matters how we resolve our disagreements.""--BOOK JACKET.",N/A,N/A,352,Biography & Autobiography,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9msaAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=9msaAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA143&dq=science+fiction&hl=&cd=218&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=9msaAQAAIAAJ&dq=science+fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api

Once and Future Antiquities in Science Fiction and Fantasy,"Brett M. Rogers, Benjamin Eldon Stevens",Bloomsbury Publishing,2018-12-27,"In 15 all-new essays, this volume explores how science fiction and fantasy draw on materials from ancient Greece and Rome, 'displacing' them from their original settings-in time and space, in points of origins and genre-and encouraging readers to consider similar 'displacements' in the modern world. Modern examples from a wide range of media and genres-including Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials and the novels of Helen Oyeyemi, the Rocky Horror Picture Show and Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away, and the role-playing games Dungeons and Dragons and Warhammer 40K-are brought alongside episodes from ancient myth, important moments from history, and more. All together, these multifaceted studies add to our understanding of how science fiction and fantasy form important areas of classical reception, not only transmitting but also transmuting images of antiquity. The volume concludes with an inspiring personal reflection from the New York Times-bestselling author of speculative fiction, Catherynne M. Valente, offering her perspective on the limitless potential of the classical world to resonate with experience today.",1350068969,9781350068964,249,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_d98DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=_d98DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=science+fiction&hl=&cd=226&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_d98DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

New Dreams for Old,Mike Resnick,Pyr,2006-06-01,"New Dreams for Old is a collection of science fiction and fantasy stories by Mike Resnick, showing the depth and range that has not only made him a popular seller, but also placed him fourth (and climbing) on the all-time award list of all science fiction writers living and dead (as compiled by Locus). This book contains award winners and nominees. It contains two stories that are currently in development by Hollywood. It contains stories that have won readers polls, that have won foreign prizes, and a few that are just out-and-out hilarious. Most of these stories constitute recent work. One of them — ""Travels With My Cats"" — was a 2005 Hugo Award-winner and a Nebula nominee, while another — ""A Princess of Earth"" — was also a 2005 Hugo nominee. The story ""Robots Don't Cry"" was a 2004 Hugo nominee the previous year. Also included are the Hugo and Nebula nominee ""For I Have Touched the Sky,"" Hugo nominee ""Mwalimu in the Squared Circle,"" and Hugo winner ""The 43 Antarean Dynasties."" This collection also includes two novellas that have never seen print outside of the members-only Science Fiction Book Club. Are there really elephants on Neptune? What does Old MacDonald of nursery-rhyme fame actually grow on his farm? Is there much difference between pruning elderly flowers and elderly people? A trio of award nominees, ""The Elephants on Neptune,"" ""Old MacDonald Had a Farm,"" and ""Hothouse Flowers,"" provide the answers. This is a collection of enormous range and the highest quality. More to the point, every story will not only make the reader think, but feel. The collection is introduced by Nancy Kress, herself a multiple Hugo and Nebula winner, and a monthly columnist for Writer's Digest.",1591024412,9781591024415,424,Fiction,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IHR38MyRyw0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=IHR38MyRyw0C&q=science+fiction&dq=science+fiction&hl=&cd=228&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=IHR38MyRyw0C&dq=science+fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api

Japanese Science Fiction,Robert Matthew,Routledge,2003-09-02,"After the Meiji Restoration of 1868 Japan modernized rapidly, transforming itself perhaps more quickly than any other country in history. However, the change was not without its conflicts, many of them still unresolved as the pleasures of modern society vie with a respect for the traditional Japanese lifestyle. As the literature of change and of the young, science fiction acts as a window to the modern mind and the uneasy alliance of the old and new. This book, filled with detailed reference to numerous stories, traces the origin and development of the genre from the mid-nineteenth century to today, thus exploring unique insights into Japanese attitudes to commercialism, spirituality, the media, war and international relations.",1134983603,9781134983605,235,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gCPIXYWkyLYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=gCPIXYWkyLYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=science+fiction&hl=&cd=239&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=gCPIXYWkyLYC&dq=science+fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api

The Great American Paperback,Richard A. Lupoff,N/A,2001,"""Few realized in 1938 that a revolution was about to take place. A little book appeared in drugstores and on newsstands that would fit into the typical pocket. There was no real binding, no dust jacket; just a colorful, laminated cover....by summer of 1939 everybody was buying and reading them. Regarded by many as disposable distractions, a few people put them aside and started collections that we realize are a valuable and collectible archive of American culture.

Futurescapes,Ralph Pordzik,Rodopi,2009,"This book testifies to the growing interest in the many spaces of utopia. It intends to 'map out' on utopian and science-fiction discourses some of the new and revisionist models of spatial analysis applied in Literary and Cultural Studies in recent years. The aim of the volume is to side-step the established generic binary of utopia and dystopia or science fiction and thus to open the analysis of utopian literature to new lines of inquiry. The essays collected here propose to think of utopias not so much as fictional texts about future change and transformation but as vital elements in a cultural process through which social, spatial and subjective identities are formed. Utopias can thus be read as textual systems implying a distinct spatial and temporal dimension; as 'spatial practices' that tend to naturalize a cultural and social construction - that of the 'good life', the radically improved welfare state, the Christian paradise, the counter-society, etc. - and make that representation operational by interpellating their readers in some determinate relation to their givenness as sites of political and individual improvement. This volume is of interest for all scholars and students of literature who wish to explore the ways in which utopias of the past and recent present have circulated as media of cultural exchange and homogenization, as sites of cultural and linguistic appropriation and as foci for the spatial formation of national and regional identities in the English-speaking world.",9042026022,9789042026025,368,Fiction,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=W3LkLqQLvdcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=W3LkLqQLvdcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=science+fiction&hl=&cd=243&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=W3LkLqQLvdcC&source=gbs_api

The Bells of Subsidence,Michael John Grist,CreateSpace,2014-03-01,"Aliqa's mind has been erased, every memory lost to the endless reticulations of the branes, but for one single word that haunts her- Temetry. With it comes an abiding hope for salvation, perhaps for the salvation of every single Bell in Subsidence's ancient fleet, but first she must hunt it down, though she doesn't even know what it is. The Bells of Subsidence tells 9 science fiction short stories that chart the untamed outer fringe of existence, filled with ruined intergalactic civilizations, lonely globe-roaming robots, and a memetic virus locked that could destroy all things. It features 4 stories previously published in professional magazines: Clarkesworld, Andromeda Spaceways, Quantum Muse, and Apocalypse Fiction. Includes: 1) The Bells of Subsidence 2) Angel, I 3) The Giant Robot and the Myna Bird 4) Route 66 5) C22 6) Cullsman #9 7) Hunting Ground 8) The Blue Chipset and the Thing 9) Universal Time Praise: - ""... the images are striking and euphonious, ... and the story is moving."" - Lois Tilton, Locus Mag - ""... beautifully written ... satisfying ... atmospheric ... emotional ..."" - Goodreads reviews About the Author: Michael John Grist is a 33-year old British writer, teacher, and ruins photographer who lives in Tokyo, Japan. He runs a website featuring his stories and photographs of ruin exploration- www.michaeljohngrist.com Excerpt: The Bell is coming. It's night, and I'm lying beside Temetry on a cold grey crater of this world's endless desert, listening to the oscillations of the Bell. At times we glimpse its Brilliance, the after-image of its long and branic toll splashing across the plush black firmament like an endless corolla borealis. I imagine it far overhead, arcing through the universe, plancking the anthropic landscape from yoke to clapper, and can think of only one word to describe it. ""Godly,"" I whisper. Temetry nods by my side. He doesn't speak, not since the last Bells came when we were babies, but I know what he's thinking. I'm thinking it also. ""How are your non-orientable insects?"" I ask. He shrugs. This shrug means he's had no breakthroughs. I know it, because he'd not be here with me if he had. The men of this world would have taken him for the Gideon heat-sink long ago. ""I won't forget you,"" I say to him quietly. He turns to me, and smiles, because he knows I cannot keep that promise. The Bell is coming tonight. His hand worms the grey sand, folds my fingers within his own, and I remember that he is the most beautiful thing I have. ""I love you,"" I whisper to him. His fingers tighten, rippling over mine in Euclidean gymnastics, until our hands are joined partway between a reticulated conch shell and an intersecting Klein bottle. I laugh. It is our joke, a vestige of what Subsidence has brought us both. We are only 11, and I love him, because I know in my heart that he will never forget me. ""I'll whisper your name to the branes until I die,"" I promise him, feeling the urgency of this moment, alone in this crater for the last time. His smile turns sad. It is the last abiding image I have of him, because then comes the sound of old Ingen, and the moment is lost. She is huffing and panting her rooty head over the crater-lip. This place is no longer special or secret. Temetry's dazzling smile is sad, forever, because I'll never see him again.",1496117115,9781496117113,102,Fiction,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fS7zoAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=fS7zoAEACAAJ&dq=science+fiction&hl=&cd=245&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=fS7zoAEACAAJ&dq=science+fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api

Posthuman Biopolitics consolidates the scholarly literature on Slonczewski’s fiction and demonstrates fruitful lines of engagement for the critical, cultural, and theoretical treatment of her characters, plots, and storyworlds. Her novels treat feminism in relation to scientific practice, resistance to domination, pacifism versus militarism, the extension of human rights to nonhuman and posthuman actors, biopolitics and posthuman ethics, and symbiosis and communication across planetary scales. Posthuman Biopolitics explores the breadth and depth of Joan Slonczewski’s vision, uncovering the reflective ethical practice that informs her science fiction.",3030364860,9783030364861,198,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NWvLDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=NWvLDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=science+fiction&hl=&cd=263&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NWvLDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api
The Stars My Destination,Alfred Bester,ibooks,2011-06-06,"﻿#5 in the Millennium SF Masterworks series, a library of the finest science fiction ever written. “Science fiction has only produced a few works of actual genius, and this is one of them.” —Joe Haldeman #5 in the Millennium SF Masterworks series, a library of the finest science fiction ever written. “Science fiction has only produced a few works of actual genius, and this is one of them.” —Joe Haldeman ""Bester at the peak of his powers is, quite simply, unbeatable” —James Lovegrove Marooned in outer space after an attack on his ship, Nomad, Gulliver Foyle lives to obsessively pursue the crew of a rescue vessel that had intended to leave him to die. When it comes to pop culture, Alfred Bester (1913-1987) is something of an unsung hero. He wrote radio scripts, screenplays, and comic books (in which capacity he created the original Green Lantern Oath). But Bester is best known for his science-fiction novels, and The Stars My Destination may be his finest creation. With its sly potshotting at corporate skullduggery, The Stars My Destination seems utterly contemporary, and has maintained its status as an underground classic for fifty years.

Partners in Wonder,Eric Leif Davin,Lexington Books,2006,"Partners in Wonder revolutionizes our knowledge of women and early science fiction. Contrary to accepted interpretations, women fans and writers were a welcome and influential part of pulp science fiction from the birth of the genre. Davin finds that at least 203 female authors, under their own female names, published over a thousand stories in science fiction magazines between 1926 and 1965. This work explores the distinctly different form of science fiction that females produced--one that was both more utopian and more empathetic than that of their male counterparts. Partners in Wonder presents, for the first time, a complete bibliography of every story published by women writers in science fiction magazines from 1926 to 1965 and brief biographies on 133 of these women writers. It is thus the most comprehensive source of information on early women science fiction writers yet available and of great importance to scholars of women's studies, popular culture, and English literature as well as science fiction.",0739112678,9780739112670,452,Fiction,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZoNDebTvUnsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,5,1,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=ZoNDebTvUnsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=science+fiction&hl=&cd=280&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=ZoNDebTvUnsC&dq=science+fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api

Anarchy's Edge,Dave Walsh,DW Science Fiction,2021-03-30,"Deep in the heart of the galaxy, an ancient, banished force lays in wait. Life has transformed for Trella. No longer bound to the old ways of her people, she seeks her place in the galaxy, only to find as her father seizes power in Andlios he may be a puppet for figures from his own past. With the help of her old friends, she must venture out further into the galaxy than she ever has before, hoping to stop the Banished before it’s too late. There’s just one problem: the Khonsu revolution finds itself besieged by the Earth Ministry. After Khonsu Station and the gate went dark, Katrijn and Jace ventured through once more, in search of Loren and their friends. What they weren’t expecting was their fragile intra-galaxy alliance hanging on by a thread as the Earth Ministry cut off Khonsu Station, looking to reclaim the station and quash the uprising before it could spread through the rest of the galaxy. Every revolution faces its past, but is that past too powerful to stop? *** KEYWORDS: science fiction, scifi book, scifi books, space opera book, space opera scifi, space opera adventure battles, science fiction female lead, strong female characters in books, anarchist scifi, cyborg fiction, space opera exploration, space viking book, anticapitalist scifi, existential scifi, scifi box set, epic space opera, scifi fantasy, space viking battles, lgbtq scifi, progressive scifi, hema battles scifi, space opera, science fiction cthulhu, lovecraftian, lovecraftian scifi For fans of: Frank Herbert, Dan Simmons, China Mieville, Isaac Asimov, Ursula K.

"The Biology of Science Fiction Cinema, 2d ed.",Mark C. Glassy,McFarland,2024-12-30,"Science fiction cinema has dramatically affected the perception of science by the general population. If science fiction and actual science sometimes seem at odds, they importantly share the elements of curiosity, creativity and imagination--and there are many examples of yesterday's science fiction becoming today's science. This book explores the imaginative elements of biology seen in 20th century science fiction films. Written by a professional scientist and science fiction lover, this second edition includes recent updates of biomedical science and science fiction cinema. It covers different categories of biology, biochemistry (or molecular biology), and medicine, each subcategorized into chapters such as cell biology, hematology, and dermatology. Within each chapter are several film examples explaining the biological sciences principles involved, what is right and what is wrong with the science, and what changes could be made for the science of the film to become a reality.",1476692335,9781476692333,352,Performing Arts,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sfw6EQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=sfw6EQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=science+fiction&hl=&cd=295&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=sfw6EQAAQBAJ&dq=science+fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api

Cultural Legal Studies of Science Fiction,"Alex Green, Mitchell Travis, Kieran Tranter",Routledge,2024-11,"This book presents and engages the world building capacity of legal theory through cultural legal studies of science and speculative fictions. In these studies, the contributors take seriously the legal world building of science and speculative fiction to reveal, animate and critique legal wisdom: juris-prudence. Following a common approach in cultural legal studies, the contributors engage directly, and in detail, with specific cultural 'texts', novels, television, films, and video games in order to explore a range of possible legal futures. The book is organized in three sections: first, the contextualisation of science and speculative fiction as jurisprudence; second, the temporality of law and legal theory; and third, the analysis of specific science and speculative fictions. Throughout, the contributors reveal the way in which law as nomos builds normative universes through the narration of a future. This book will appeal to scholars and students with interests in legal theory, cultural legal studies, law and the humanities, and law and literature.",1032534338,9781032534336,0,Law,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=f0C20AEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=f0C20AEACAAJ&dq=science+fiction&hl=&cd=321&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=f0C20AEACAAJ&dq=science+fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api

Science Fiction and the Moral Imagination,Russell Blackford,Springer,2017-09-14,"In this highly original book, Russell Blackford discusses the intersection of science fiction and humanity’s moral imagination. With the rise of science and technology in the 19th century, and our continually improving understanding of the cosmos, writers and thinkers soon began to imagine futures greatly different from the present. Science fiction was born out of the realization that future technoscientific advances could dramatically change the world. Along with the developments described in modern science fiction - space societies, conscious machines, and upgraded human bodies, to name but a few - come a new set of ethical challenges and new forms of ethics. Blackford identifies these issues and their reflection in science fiction. His fascinating book will appeal to anyone with an interest in philosophy or science fiction, or in how they interact. “This is a seasoned, balanced analysis of a major issue in our thinking about the future, seen through the lens of science fiction, a central art of our time. Everyone from humanists to technologists should study these ideas and examples. Blackford’s book is wise and savvy, and a delight to read as well.” Greg Benford, author of Timescape.",3319616838,9783319616834,204,Philosophy,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=c6B5swEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=c6B5swEACAAJ&dq=science+fiction&hl=&cd=329&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=c6B5swEACAAJ&dq=science+fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api
A World of Soma,Zvee Gilead,iUniverse,2011-07-07,"For some, the pursuit of happiness does not come easily. Almost by definition, being human means to be imperfect, scratched, and scarred. Countless multitudes of men, women, and children are prevented from that very pursuit because they suffer from depression or various mental disorders. But then, four scientists working on the edge of possibility and hope invent a drug that eliminates depression, and a new era of peace and bliss for all emerges. Blending science fiction with hard science, this contemporary fairy tale for a technological world explores the very morality of such a discovery. The work of the fictional scientists is based on real-world research, and they explore the psycho-neurological causes of depression and how new drugs are developed. Can four scientists actually create a sustainable utopia in a lab? Can bliss in a pill truly come without consequences? Is peace for all mankind even a possibility? Sometimes, the price of true happinesseven when it comes in a little pillmay be higher than expected.",1462019773,9781462019779,234,Fiction,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=at6WkR-XmIYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=at6WkR-XmIYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=science+fiction&hl=&cd=330&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=at6WkR-XmIYC&source=gbs_api

Unpainted to the Last,Elizabeth A. Schultz,N/A,1995,"Endlessly pursued but ever elusive, Moby-Dick roams freely throughout the American imagination. A fathomless source for literary exploration, Melville's masterpiece has also inspired a stunning array of book illustrations, prints, comics, paintings, sculptures, mixed media, and even architectural designs. Innovative and lavishly illustrated, Unpainted to the Last illuminates this impressive body of work and shows how it opens up our understanding of both Moby-Dick and twentieth-century American art. The most continuously, frequently, and diversely illustrated of all American novels, Moby-Dick has attracted some remarkable book illustrators in Rockwell Kent, Boardman Robinson, Garrick Palmer, Barry Moser, and Bill Sienkiewicz, among others represented here. It has also inspired extraordinary creations by such prominent artists as Jackson Pollock, Frank Stella, Sam Francis, Benton Spruance, Leonard Baskin, Theodoros Stamos, Richard Ellis, Ralph Goings, Seymour Lipton, Walter Martin, Tony Rosenthal, Richard Serra, and Theodore Roszak. The artists reflect in equal measure the novel's realistic (plot, character, natural history) and philosophical modes, its visual and visionary dimensions. Some, like the obsessed and haunted Gilbert Wilson, claim Moby-Dick as their ""Bible."" Still others view the novel as a touchstone for feminist, multicultural, and environmentalist themes, or mock its status as a cultural icon.",N/A,N/A,452,Art,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mk5XAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=mk5XAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA4&dq=science+fiction&hl=&cd=351&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=mk5XAAAAYAAJ&dq=science+fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api

Old Mars,"George R. R. Martin, Gardner Dozois",Bantam,2013-10-08,"Fifteen all-new stories by science fiction’s top talents, collected by bestselling author George R. R. Martin and multiple-award winning editor Gardner Dozois Burroughs’s A Princess of Mars. Bradbury’s The Martian Chronicles. Heinlein’s Red Planet. These and so many more inspired generations of readers with a sense that science fiction’s greatest wonders did not necessarily lie far in the future or light-years across the galaxy but were to be found right now on a nearby world tantalizingly similar to our own—a red planet that burned like an ember in our night sky . . . and in our imaginations. This new anthology of fifteen all-original science fiction stories, edited by George R. R. Martin and Gardner Dozois, celebrates the Golden Age of Science Fiction, an era filled with tales of interplanetary colonization and derring-do. Before the advent of powerful telescopes and space probes, our solar system could be imagined as teeming with strange life-forms and ancient civilizations—by no means always friendly to the dominant species of Earth. And of all the planets orbiting that G-class star we call the Sun, none was so steeped in an aura of romantic decadence, thrilling mystery, and gung-ho adventure as Mars. Join such seminal contributors as Michael Moorcock, Mike Resnick, Joe R. Lansdale, S. M. Stirling, Mary Rosenblum, Ian McDonald, Liz Williams, James S. A. Corey, and others in this brilliant retro anthology that turns its back on the cold, all-but-airless Mars of the Mariner probes and instead embraces an older, more welcoming, more exotic Mars: a planet of ancient canals cutting through red deserts studded with the ruined cities of dying races.

The Anticipation Novelists of 1950s French Science Fiction,Bradford Lyau,McFarland,2014-01-10,"Following World War II, the Fleuve Noir publishing house published popular American genre fiction in translation for a French audience. Their imprint Anticipation specialized in science fiction, but mostly eschewed translations from English, preferring instead French work, thus making the imprint an important outlet for native French postwar ideas and aesthetics. This critical text examines in ideological terms eleven writers who published under the Anticipation imprint, revealing the way these writers criticized midcentury notions of progress while adapting and reworking American genre formats.",0786462175,9780786462179,249,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oo6YXHqbUPMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=oo6YXHqbUPMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=science+fiction&hl=&cd=355&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oo6YXHqbUPMC&source=gbs_api

Understanding Contemporary American Science Fiction,Darren Harris-Fain,Univ of South Carolina Press,2005,"Understanding Contemporary American Science Fiction: The Age of Maturity, 1970-2000 explores the major trends and developments during three decades that witnessed science fiction's most dramatic progression from subliterary escapist entertainment to a more sophisticated literature of ideas. Darren Harris-Fain suggests that to understand American science fiction fully, it is essential to realize that the current field with all its variety results from the proceeding decades of writings. In addition, he contends that although much science fiction of merit was written in America prior to 1970, the latter decades of the twentieth century witnessed a dramatic improvement in quality, even as the field fragmented into a variety of subgenres and as writers sought to transcend earlier critical dismissals. Harris-Fain discusses significant and representative works, most of which mainstream literary scholars and critics ignore, as he charts the historical and literary development of contemporary American science fiction. the internal divisions along both literary and political lines experienced during the Vietnam era; the influence of the feminist movement and other contemporary concerns; the increasing contributions of female, African American, and gay and lesbian writers; and the emergence of such significant trends as hard science fiction, cyberpunk, alternate history, and shared-world stories. Harris-Fain also considers literary science fiction's relationship to the mass media, the effects the popularity of fantasy has on the field, and academia's continued misprizing of the genre.",1570035857,9781570035852,248,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3pHm6_8kBM4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=3pHm6_8kBM4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=science+fiction&hl=&cd=371&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=3pHm6_8kBM4C&dq=science+fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api

Simultaneous Worlds,"Jennifer L. Feeley, Sarah Ann Wells",U of Minnesota Press,2015-10-01,"Since the 1927 release of Fritz Lang’s pioneer film Metropolis, science fiction cinema has largely been regarded a Western genre. In Simultaneous Worlds, Jennifer L. Feeley and Sarah Ann Wells showcase authors who challenge this notion by focusing on cinemas and cultures, from Cuba to North Korea, not traditionally associated with science fiction. This collection introduces films about a metal-eating monster who helps peasants overthrow an exploitative court, an inflatable sex doll who comes to life, a desert planet where matchsticks are more valuable than money, and more. Simultaneous Worlds is the first volume to bring a transnational, interdisciplinary lens to science fiction cinema. Encountering some of the best emerging and established voices in the field, readers will become immersed in discussions of well-known works such as the Ghost in the Shell franchise and Neill Blomkamp’s District 9 alongside lesser-known but equally fascinating works by African, Asian, European, and South American filmmakers. Divided into five parts that cover theoretical concerns such as new media economies, translation, the Global South, cyborgs, and socialist and postsocialist cinema, these essays trace cinema’s role in imagining global communities and power struggles. Considering both individual films and the broader networks of production, distribution, and exhibition, Simultaneous Worlds illustrates how film industries across the globe take part in visualizing the perils of globalization and technological modernity. Ultimately, this book opens new ways of thinking about world cinema and our understanding of the world at large.",1452944253,9781452944258,308,Art,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sih0DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=sih0DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=science+fiction&hl=&cd=381&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sih0DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

"Movies, Modernism, and the Science Fiction Pulps",J. P. Telotte,N/A,2019,"What impact did the new art of film have on the development of another new art, the emerging science fiction genre, during the pre- and early post-World War II era? Focusing on such popular pulp magazines as Amazing Stories, Astounding Stories, and Wonder Stories, this book traces this early relationship between film and literature through four common features: stories that involve film or the film industry; film-related advertising; editorial matters and readers' letters commenting on film; and the magazines' heralded cover and story illustrations. By surveying these haunting traces of another medium in early science fiction discourse, we can begin to see the key role that a cinematic mindedness played in this formative era and to expand the early history of science fiction as a cultural idea beyond the usual boundaries that have been staked out by its literary manifestations and the genre's historians.",0190949651,9780190949655,201,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ajmdDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=ajmdDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=science+fiction&hl=&cd=386&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=ajmdDwAAQBAJ&dq=science+fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api

Science Fiction Cinema,Christine Cornea,N/A,2007,"This major new study offers a broad historical and theoretical reassessment of the science fiction film genre. The book explores the development of science fiction in cinema from its beginnings in early film through to recent examples of the genre. Each chapter sets analyses of chosen films within a wider historical/cultural context, while concentrating on a specific thematic issue. The book therefore presents vital and unique perspectives in its approach to the genre, which include discussion of the relevance of psychedelic imagery, the 'new woman of science', generic performance and the prevalence of 'techno-orientalism' in recent films. While American films will be one of the principle areas covered, the author also engages with a range of pertinent examples from other nations, as well as discussing the centrality of science fiction as a transnational film genre. Films discussed include The Day the Earth Stood Still, The Body Snatchers, Forbidden Planet, The Quatermass Experiment, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Demon Seed, Star Trek: The Motion Picture, Star Wars, Altered States, Alien, Blade Runner, The Brother from Another Planet, Back to the Future, The Terminator, Predator, The One, Dark City, The Matrix, Fifth Elementand eXistenZ.

Brood of the Dark Moon,Charles Willard Diffin,VM eBooks,2016-01-21,"Chapter I The Message [Sidenote: Once more Chet, Walt and Diane are united in a wild ride to the Dark Moon--but this time they go as prisoners of their deadly enemy Schwartzmann.] In a hospital in Vienna, in a room where sunlight flooded through ultraviolet permeable crystal, the warm rays struck upon smooth walls the color of which changed from hot reds to cool yellow or gray or to soothing green, as the Directing Surgeon might order. An elusive blending of tones now seemed pulsing with life; surely even a flickering flame of vitality would be blown into warm livingness in such a place. Even the chart case in the wall glittered with the same clean, brilliant hues from its glass and metal door. The usual revolving paper disks showed white beyond the glass. They were moving; and the ink lines grew to tell a story of temperature and respiration and of every heart-beat. On the identification-plate a name appeared and a date: ""Chet Bullard--23 years. Admitted: August 10, 1973."" And below that the ever-changing present ticked into the past in silent minutes: ""August 15, 1973; World Standard Time: 10:38--10:39--10:40--"" For five days the minutes had trickled into a rivulet of time that flowed past a bandaged figure in the bed below--a silent figure and unmoving, as one for whom time has ceased.

Worlds and selves falling apart - The science fiction of Philip K. Dick,Markus Widmer,GRIN Verlag,2003-06-26,"Swiss Diploma Thesis from the year 2000 in the subject American Studies - Literature, grade: 1.5 (A), University of Zurich (English Seminar), language: English, abstract: Philip K. Dick's science fiction can be seen as a discussion of the human condition in a world where nothing is what it seems. Human identity has become uncertain, as has the nature of reality itself. This Dickian ontology has a striking similarity to postmodernist theories by thinkers such as Jameson, Baudrillard and McHale, most of whom, by the way, have a weak spot for science fiction. The discussion of Philip K. Dick's novels and short stories against a backdrop of postmodernist theory leads to conclusions that are not only relevant for the author's particular poetics, but for the ontology of our lives in times that science fiction couldn't have imagined. This work focusses on Philip K. Dick's unstable worlds and subjects, investigating Dickian space, time and meaning as well as the author's subjects and the question of schizophrenia and paranoia. Works discussed include Ubik, Time Out of Joint, The Man in the High Castle, A Maze of Death, Eye in the Sky, A Scanner Darkly, Martian Time-Slip and Impostor.",3638200876,9783638200875,96,Literary Collections,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wNMOy31xwt8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=wNMOy31xwt8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=science+fiction&hl=&cd=401&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=wNMOy31xwt8C&dq=science+fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api
Equipping Space Cadets,Emily Midkiff,Univ. Press of Mississippi,2022-04-19,"Winner of the 2023 Science Fiction Research Association (SFRA) Book Award 2022 Longlist Nominee for the Best Non-Fiction Award from the British Science Fiction Association Equipping Space Cadets: Primary Science Fiction for Young Children argues for the benefits and potential of “primary science fiction,” or science fiction for children under twelve years old. Science fiction for children is often disregarded due to common misconceptions of childhood. When children are culturally portrayed as natural and simple, they seem like a poor audience for the complex scientific questions brought up by the best science fiction. The books and the children who read them tell another story. Using three empirical studies and over 350 children’s books including If I Had a Robot Dog, Bugs in Space, and Commander Toad in Space, Equipping Space Cadets presents interdisciplinary evidence that science fiction and children are compatible after all. Primary science fiction literature includes many high-quality books that cleverly utilize the features of children’s literature formats in order to fit large science fiction questions into small packages. In the best of these books, authors make science fiction questions accessible and relevant to children of various reading levels and from diverse backgrounds and identities. Equipping Space Cadets does not stop with literary analysis, but also presents the voices of real children and practitioners. The book features three studies: a survey of teachers and librarians, quantitative analysis of lending records from school libraries across the United States, and coded read-aloud sessions with elementary school students. The results reveal how children are interested in and capable of reading science fiction, but it is the adults, including the most well-intentioned librarians and teachers, who hinder children's engagement with the genre due to their own preconceptions about the genre and children.",149683898X,9781496838988,213,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yGJsEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=yGJsEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=science+fiction&hl=&cd=402&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yGJsEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

People forget that humans created the Machine, and treat it as a mystical entity whose needs supersede their own.

This original story by Baoshu—published with Liu’s support—envisions the aftermath of the conflict between humanity and the extraterrestrial Trisolarans. In the midst of an interstellar war, Yun Tianming found himself on the front lines. Riddled with cancer, he chose to end his life, only to find himself flash frozen and launched into space where the Trisolaran First Fleet awaited. Captured and tortured beyond endurance for decades, Yun eventually succumbed to helping the aliens subjugate humanity in order to save Earth from complete destruction. Granted a healthy clone body by the Trisolarans, Yun has spent his very long life in exile as a traitor to the human race. Nearing the end of his existence at last, he suddenly receives another reprieve—and another regeneration. A consciousness calling itself The Spirit has recruited him to wage battle against an entity that threatens the existence of the entire universe.

Germany,"Laurence a Laurence, Laurence A. Rickels",Anti-Oedipus Press,2015-03-01,"In I THINK I AM: PHILIP K. DICK, Laurence A. Rickels investigated the renowned science fiction author's collected work by way of its relationship to the concept and condition of schizophrenia. In GERMANY: A SCIENCE FICTION, he focuses on psychopathy as the undeclared diagnosis implied in flunking the empathy test. The switch from psychosis to psychopathy as an organizing limit opens the prospect of a genealogy of the Cold War era, which Rickels begins by examining Dick's THE SIMULACRA and follows out with readings of SIMULACRON 3, FAHRENHEIT 451, THE DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS, THIS ISLAND EARTH and GRAVITY'S RAINBOW, among many other genealogical stations. Nazi Germany hosted the first season of the realization of science fantasy with the rocket at the top of this arc. After World War II, the genre had to delete the recent past and start again within the new Cold War opposition. Certainly the ancestral prehistory was still intact (in the works of, for instance, Jules Verne and H. G. Wells). At the bulk rate of its generic line of production, however, science fiction would thereafter become a native to the Cold War habitat. This study addresses the syndications of the missing era in the science fiction mainstream, the phantasmagoria of its returns, and the extent of the integration of all the above since some point in the 1980s. Rickels works through the preliminaries of repair that must be met in a world devastated by psychopathic violence before mourning can even be a need. While I THINK I AM was the endopsychic allegory of Dick's corpus, GERMANY takes the corpus as a point of context for the endopsychic genealogy of the post-WWII containment and integration of psychopathy.",0989239179,9780989239172,274,Psychopaths in literature,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RHwOrgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=RHwOrgEACAAJ&dq=science+fiction&hl=&cd=431&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=RHwOrgEACAAJ&dq=science+fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api

Italian Science Fiction,"Simone Brioni, Daniele Comberiati",Springer,2019-07-18,"This book explores Italian science fiction from 1861, the year of Italy’s unification, to the present day, focusing on how this genre helped shape notions of Otherness and Normalness. In particular, Italian Science Fiction draws upon critical race studies, postcolonial theory, and feminist studies to explore how migration, colonialism, multiculturalism, and racism have been represented in genre film and literature. Topics include the role of science fiction in constructing a national identity; the representation and self-representation of “alien” immigrants in Italy; the creation of internal “Others,” such as southerners and Roma; the intersections of gender and race discrimination; and Italian science fiction’s transnational dialogue with foreign science fiction. This book reveals that though it is arguably a minor genre in Italy, science fiction offers an innovative interpretive angle for rethinking Italian history and imagining future change in Italian society.",3030193268,9783030193263,298,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lOijDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=lOijDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=science+fiction&hl=&cd=451&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lOijDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Voyagers II,Ben Bova,Tor Books,2010-08-31,"Multi-Hugo Award-winning author Ben Bova continues the story of Earth's first extraterrestrial contact with Voyagers II: The Alien Within. Eighteen years ago, astronaut Keith Stoner had been the American member of a joint U.S.–Soviet mission to capture an alien ship that had entered the solar system. It was the greatest adventure in the history of Earth—but disaster struck when a bomb placed on the Soviet craft forced its recall. Stoner refused to return to Earth, staying behind in the strange ship alone where he fell into suspended animation. Jo Camerata, the ambitious young student who fell in love with Stoner, is now head of Vanguard Industries. Jo's dogged determination has forced the recovery of the alien ship, and now her company is in control of the vast new technology—and in control of Keith Stoner. What Camerata doesn't know, however, is that when Stoner wakes, someone else awakens, too. The alien presence in Stoner's mind that has kept him alive all these years is now free, and intends to explore the world. And it will let nothing stand in its way.

Rage of Stars: Book Three of the Sigil Trilogy,Henry Gee,Reanimus Press,2012-09-27,"Print edition of the concluding volume to Henry Gee's incredible Sigil Trilogy! The Universe is still dying from within and the young Drover tasked with stopping the rot is still racing against time. For fifty years, former textile merchant Mr Haraddzjin Khorare has been Chancellor of a Kingdom unequalled in brutality. And it's about to get a whole lot worse. Dogfinger is a boy orphaned when his village is razed by Stoners. One day, he knows, the time will come for revenge. Domingo-scientist, Priest and Pope-is watching, helpless, as the world circles to its doom. What we need, he thinks, is a miracle. Will his prayers be answered? The Plague has forced Jadis Markham and Jack Corstophine to give up their research in favour of survival. But there are always questions left to answer. Their son, Tom, now himself a noted anthropologist, has an encounter that will force him to confront his own nature-and the very nature of the universe, as the stars themselves begin going dark. Rage of Stars is the climactic third volume of The Sigil, Henry Gee's epic tale that explores the nature of humanity, religion and love. Praise for THE SIGIL TRILOGY: ""Great stuff. Touches of Douglas Adams, Barrington Bayley, David Britton and Steve Ayelet only emphasise the splendid originality of this book. Henry Gee is thoughtful, funny, original. And pretty thoroughly mind-expanding in the tradition of Wells, David Lindsay, Stapledon and Clarke. In fact everything you yearn to find in a very good contemporary SF novel. Really enjoyed it!"" -SFWA Grandmaster Michael Moorcock ""Coming to a science fiction novel by Henry Gee I was expecting a work knowledgeable about the world and all its ways, but who would have guessed it would also reveal Henry to be a visionary space voyager of the first order? The Sigil is in the grand tradition of Stapledonian space opera, and provides not only an explanation for why this universe is the way it is, but gives us the many vivid wild adventures on the part of some (very appealing) conscious characters acting to make it that way. Awesome stuff, and a true pleasure to read page by page."" -Kim Stanley Robinson, award-winning author of Red Mars ""Fast-moving, insanely inventive science fiction in the grand manner-seldom has the fate of the galaxy been handled on such a large scale. Gee draws on archeology, geology, physics, and biology to create a rich tapestry with surprises woven into every thread."" -Nancy Kress ""Siege is compelling, grandiose, and breathtaking in its spacetime and its characters are intriguing, personal, and complex....This book of Henry's is going to be high on the charts."" -scienceblogs.com ""Echoes of Olaf Stapledon and Arthur C. Clarke, with more interesting characters than either of them."" -John Gribbin ""Cosmically deep and sensually rich, here is a very warm, enthusiastic and human book about great issues of our own world and of the whole universe, beautifully written. What can I say but: Gee Whiz! (unless somebody already has...)"" -Ian Watson ""One of the very best books I've ever read."" -Critique.org ""Henry Gee serves up a tasty stew of sex, science and space opera. Or should that read romance, rationality and retro-SF? Either way, the book is great entertainment."" -Vaughan Stanger ""A great very-wide-screen story, with many interesting characters I cared about...the writing-and the palaeontology-are beautifully executed"" -Jack Cohen, author of Wheelers and Heaven ""wildly imaginative... personalities and relationships drive the story forward as much as its grandiose scale, making ""Siege"" difficult to put down."" -Alex Shvartsman ""Henry Gee's crackling prose and fast-paced storytelling pull the reader right in, but it's the vividness of his characters that creates such a sense of intimacy in this large-scale cosmic tale.

The Time Machine (Annotated and Illustrated) (Pictures),H. G.

Wells's successful career and earned him his reputation as the father of science fiction. With a speculative leap that still fires the imagination, Wells sends his brave explorer to face a future burdened with our greatest hopes...and our darkest fears.A pull of the Time Machine's lever propels him to the age of a slowly dying Earth. There he discovers two bizarre races--the ethereal Eloi and the subterranean Morlocks--who not only symbolize the duality of human nature, but offer a terrifying portrait of the men of tomorrow as well. Published in 1895, this masterpiece of invention captivated readers on the threshold of a new century. Thanks to Wells's expert storytelling and provocative insight, The Time Machine will continue to enthrall readers for generations to come.",N/A,9798619052114,113,N/A,en,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=Q4Z3zQEACAAJ&dq=science+fiction&hl=&cd=490&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=Q4Z3zQEACAAJ&dq=science+fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api
Where No Man Has Gone Before,Lucie Armitt,Routledge,2012,"How do women writers use science fiction to challenge assumptions about the genre and its representations of women? To what extent is the increasing number of women writing science fiction reformulating the expectations of readers and critics? From Mary Shelley onwards, women writers have played a central role in the shaping and reshaping of this genre, irrespective of its undeniably patriarchal image. Essays on the work of writers such as Doris Lessing and Ursula Le Guin, Katherine Burdekin, C. L. Moor, Suzette Elgin, Gwyneth Jones, Maureen Duffy and Josephine Saxton demonstrate that science fiction remains as particularly well-suited to the exploration of woman as 'alien' or 'other' in our culture today, as it was with the publication of Frankenstein in 1818.",0415521254,9780415521253,250,Fiction,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=A91EQB3QpqgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=A91EQB3QpqgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=science+fiction&hl=&cd=491&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=A91EQB3QpqgC&dq=science+fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api

The Orchid Cage,Herbert W. Franke,Springer,2024-07-01,"This book is a new English translation of the classic science fiction story written in 1961 by Herbert W. Franke, widely held to be the most important German-language science-fiction writer. A dead city on a distant planet, two groups of people trying to explore it. Step by step, they penetrate the outer ring with its ultra-modern technology, the half-ruined medieval city center and finally the mysterious center. But is the eerie city really dead? Suddenly the factories start working again, the automatons intervene, and somewhere in the background there is still something hidden that could perhaps awaken. But is it people or machines? Herbert W. Franke leads the reader into an oppressively strange world; only after the startling resolution does it become clear what lies behind the adventures of the intruders - not a cosmic strangeness, but a threatening development that could affect humans in the same way. Franke's novel is thus a parable of the evolution of all humans in the age of technical communication ...",3031604989,9783031604980,0,Fiction,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0AOp0AEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=0AOp0AEACAAJ&dq=science+fiction&hl=&cd=525&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=0AOp0AEACAAJ&dq=science+fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api

Voyagers II,Ben Bova,Tor Books,2010-08-31,"Multi-Hugo Award-winning author Ben Bova continues the story of Earth's first extraterrestrial contact with Voyagers II: The Alien Within. Eighteen years ago, astronaut Keith Stoner had been the American member of a joint U.S.–Soviet mission to capture an alien ship that had entered the solar system. It was the greatest adventure in the history of Earth—but disaster struck when a bomb placed on the Soviet craft forced its recall. Stoner refused to return to Earth, staying behind in the strange ship alone where he fell into suspended animation. Jo Camerata, the ambitious young student who fell in love with Stoner, is now head of Vanguard Industries. Jo's dogged determination has forced the recovery of the alien ship, and now her company is in control of the vast new technology—and in control of Keith Stoner. What Camerata doesn't know, however, is that when Stoner wakes, someone else awakens, too. The alien presence in Stoner's mind that has kept him alive all these years is now free, and intends to explore the world. And it will let nothing stand in its way.

Rage of Stars: Book Three of the Sigil Trilogy,Henry Gee,Reanimus Press,2012-09-27,"Print edition of the concluding volume to Henry Gee's incredible Sigil Trilogy! The Universe is still dying from within and the young Drover tasked with stopping the rot is still racing against time. For fifty years, former textile merchant Mr Haraddzjin Khorare has been Chancellor of a Kingdom unequalled in brutality. And it's about to get a whole lot worse. Dogfinger is a boy orphaned when his village is razed by Stoners. One day, he knows, the time will come for revenge. Domingo-scientist, Priest and Pope-is watching, helpless, as the world circles to its doom. What we need, he thinks, is a miracle. Will his prayers be answered? The Plague has forced Jadis Markham and Jack Corstophine to give up their research in favour of survival. But there are always questions left to answer. Their son, Tom, now himself a noted anthropologist, has an encounter that will force him to confront his own nature-and the very nature of the universe, as the stars themselves begin going dark. Rage of Stars is the climactic third volume of The Sigil, Henry Gee's epic tale that explores the nature of humanity, religion and love. Praise for THE SIGIL TRILOGY: ""Great stuff. Touches of Douglas Adams, Barrington Bayley, David Britton and Steve Ayelet only emphasise the splendid originality of this book. Henry Gee is thoughtful, funny, original. And pretty thoroughly mind-expanding in the tradition of Wells, David Lindsay, Stapledon and Clarke. In fact everything you yearn to find in a very good contemporary SF novel. Really enjoyed it!"" -SFWA Grandmaster Michael Moorcock ""Coming to a science fiction novel by Henry Gee I was expecting a work knowledgeable about the world and all its ways, but who would have guessed it would also reveal Henry to be a visionary space voyager of the first order? The Sigil is in the grand tradition of Stapledonian space opera, and provides not only an explanation for why this universe is the way it is, but gives us the many vivid wild adventures on the part of some (very appealing) conscious characters acting to make it that way. Awesome stuff, and a true pleasure to read page by page."" -Kim Stanley Robinson, award-winning author of Red Mars ""Fast-moving, insanely inventive science fiction in the grand manner-seldom has the fate of the galaxy been handled on such a large scale. Gee draws on archeology, geology, physics, and biology to create a rich tapestry with surprises woven into every thread."" -Nancy Kress ""Siege is compelling, grandiose, and breathtaking in its spacetime and its characters are intriguing, personal, and complex....This book of Henry's is going to be high on the charts."" -scienceblogs.com ""Echoes of Olaf Stapledon and Arthur C. Clarke, with more interesting characters than either of them."" -John Gribbin ""Cosmically deep and sensually rich, here is a very warm, enthusiastic and human book about great issues of our own world and of the whole universe, beautifully written. What can I say but: Gee Whiz! (unless somebody already has...)"" -Ian Watson ""One of the very best books I've ever read."" -Critique.org ""Henry Gee serves up a tasty stew of sex, science and space opera. Or should that read romance, rationality and retro-SF? Either way, the book is great entertainment."" -Vaughan Stanger ""A great very-wide-screen story, with many interesting characters I cared about...the writing-and the palaeontology-are beautifully executed"" -Jack Cohen, author of Wheelers and Heaven ""wildly imaginative... personalities and relationships drive the story forward as much as its grandiose scale, making ""Siege"" difficult to put down."" -Alex Shvartsman ""Henry Gee's crackling prose and fast-paced storytelling pull the reader right in, but it's the vividness of his characters that creates such a sense of intimacy in this large-scale cosmic tale. It's an impressive fiction debut, a page-turner that delivers the goods!"" -Mercurio D.
