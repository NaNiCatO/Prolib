The Public Sector in an Age of Austerity,"Bryan M. Evans, Carlo Fanelli",McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP,2018-07-23,"Following the 2008 global financial crisis, Canada appeared to escape the austerity implemented elsewhere, but this was spin hiding the reality. A closer look reveals that the provinces – responsible for delivering essential public and social services such as education and healthcare – shouldered the burden. The Public Sector in an Age of Austerity examines public-sector austerity in the provinces and territories, specifically addressing how austerity was implemented, what forms austerity agendas took (from regressive taxes and new user fees to public-sector layoffs and privatization schemes), and what, if any, political responses resulted. Contributors focus on the period from 2007 to 2015, the global financial crisis and the period of fiscal consolidation that followed, while also providing a longer historical context – austerity is not a new phenomenon. A granular examination of each jurisdiction identifies how changing fiscal conditions have affected the delivery of public services and restructured public finances, highlighting the consequences such changes have had for public-sector workers and users of public services. The first book of its kind in Canada, The Public Sector in an Age of Austerity challenges conventional wisdom by showing that Canada did not escape post-crisis austerity, and that its recovery has been vastly overstated.",0773554181,9780773554184,433,Political Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jCdjDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=jCdjDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA124&dq=Finance&hl=&cd=23&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jCdjDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

How to Build a Bank,Ravi Takhar,Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG,2024-01-29,"As has been proven time and again, banks are the single most important business institution in any economy. If they fail, the whole economy fails. How to Build a Bank sets out, in a manner that is completely unprecedented, all the requirements for the core documentation essential for the operation of a bank. The book takes the reader through the core requirements to operate a bank, and then provides actual examples of the relevant regulatory documentation required for the bank‘s operation, the rationale for the documentation and the details and information required to complete the documentation. Each chapter of the book includes a template of the key regulatory documents required to operate a bank. The book thus simplifies a very complex area of regulatory and banking laws and rules to enable a better understanding of the banking sector and a better understanding of the key requirements for a successful long-term banking business. It is essential reading for bank executives, financial service executives, regulators, lawyers, accountants and professionals involved in bank and financial service authorisation and bank and financial service operations. It will also be very helpful for anyone wishing to understand how the most important business institutions in an economy work and the lessons that can be learned from understanding the detailed regulatory requirements to ensure their success and long-term viability.",3111102912,9783111102917,365,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GD7nEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=GD7nEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA119&dq=Finance&hl=&cd=39&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GD7nEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Institutional Banking for Emerging Markets,Wei-Xin Huang,John Wiley & Sons,2007-04-04,"In today's competitive banking industry, institutional banking is attracting greater interest. Under the globalization umbrella, inter-bank business is undergoing dynamic change and is transcending the boundaries of traditional correspondent banking. In today's climate, no bank, regardless of size, can grow without the cooperation of other banks and no bank can hope to survive and prosper without utilizing emerging markets. Institutional banking in emerging countries has some unique functions: for example, problem solving is heavier and more crucial in emerging markets than in developed countries, given the irregularity of the market and non-transparency of the financial/legal systems. Moreover, it is particularly necessary to forge good relationships, day-to-day contact and personal communication, to provide better chances for product marketing and risk management. Products are therefore tailor-made and adapted as the situation dictates, a successful lesson for one case in one country cannot necessarily be repeated in another. Huang provides a systematic framework for the subject combining both principles and practice. The direct experience of the author, allows him to write authoritatively about the subject with academic vigour as well as a large amount of practical knowledge which only a practitioner can provide. The book contains numerous real life examples and case studies to allow the reader an insight into how Institutional Banking actually works in the real world. The book also contains a supplementary CD which includes chapter summary's and further information.

An Introduction to the Law on Financial Investment,Iain G MacNeil,Bloomsbury Publishing,2012-01-20,"Since the publication of the first edition of this book in 2005, the world of financial investment has experienced an unprecedented boom followed by a spectacular bust. Significant changes have been proposed and in some cases implemented in areas such as the structure of regulation, the organisation of markets, supervision of market participants and the protection of consumers. The second edition takes account of these developments, integrating them into an analytical framework that enables the reader to develop a critical overview of the role of general legal rules and specialised systems of regulation in financial investment. The framework focuses on the role of contract, trusts and regulation as the primary legal influences for financial investment. The first part explores the relationship between investment, law and regulation. The second part examines the nature of investments and investors, both professional and private. The third part discusses the central role of corporate finance and corporate governance in linking investors with enterprises that require external capital. The fourth part examines the nature, operation and regulation of markets and the participants that support the functioning of the markets. The objective remains to provide a broadly-based and critical account of the role of law in financial investment. ""MacNeil's eloquent and informative distillation of the regulatory fundamentals of investment law gives his book much international relevance...a timely contribution to help readers decipher the seemingly inextricable maze of financial regulation...Practitioners and legal policy advisers will..welcome it. They should find enlightening the book's careful scrutiny of the trust and contractual foundations of investment law and practice.""

Promoting Sustainable Innovation and the Circular Economy,"Ole-Andreas Rognstad, Taina Pihlajarinne, Jukka Mähönen",Taylor & Francis,2024-07-26,"The book explores the role of public market actors in sustainable and circular economy innovation and financing. The shift to a circular economy requires active innovation, alongside radical changes in law, finance and policy considerations, since regulation is often tightly connected with the assumption of a linear model of consumption. Finance is crucial in creating sustainable and circular economy markets and innovations: public finance is important from the perspective of seeing the state as an engine for promoting sustainable innovations, but private funds are also required. Legislative initiatives for promoting repairs have been proposed or adopted in the EU, US and in Australia, representing remarkable steps forward but still leaving many obstacles without legislative intervention. This book examines circular economy regulation and policy on a comprehensive, general level, as well as assessing the regulatory possibilities of promoting the right to repair. Promotion of circular economy innovations as well as changing the practices and changing consumer patterns towards a more comprehensive adoption of CE are discussed from perspectives of legal, social and moral norms. The book critically evaluates current legislative reforms and assesses existing barriers to the circular economy and innovation in intellectual property law, consumer law and competition law. Providing an in-depth analysis of this dynamic field, geared towards reconsidering both existing and prospective policies and regulatory regime, the book makes recommendations for solutions to legislative barriers. It is an indispensable resource for both researchers and practitioners working at the intersections of markets, innovations and sustainability.",1040104703,9781040104705,170,Law,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ytsSEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=ytsSEQAAQBAJ&pg=PT20&dq=Finance&hl=&cd=68&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=ytsSEQAAQBAJ&dq=Finance&hl=&source=gbs_api

Growth Convergence and Public Finances of India and Its States,"Mr. Rajan Govil, Khyati Chauhan",International Monetary Fund,2024-11-15,"Lack of convergence in per capita income across Indian states requires greater resources for lower-income states for investment and improved public services. Central and state governments need to raise revenue (both tax and non-tax), dismantle the administered pricing mechanism, reduce subsidies, and reorient expenditure toward national and state-level priorities. This is essential to ensure India remains on a sustainable fiscal path with higher growth, given the high public debt at the centre and state level. The observed wide differences in fiscal parameters across states require a tailored policy for each state. The large stock of debt of several states puts at risk the adequate financing of growth-enchancing expenditures.",N/A,9798400289286,50,N/A,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bKQyEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=bKQyEQAAQBAJ&pg=PA18&dq=Finance&hl=&cd=86&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=bKQyEQAAQBAJ&dq=Finance&hl=&source=gbs_api

Principles of Quantitative Development,Manoj Thulasidas,John Wiley & Sons,2010-08-09,"Principles of Quantitative Development is a practical guide to designing, building and deploying a trading platform. It is also a lucid and succinct exposé on the trade life cycle and the business groups involved in managing it, bringing together the big picture of how a trade flows through the systems, and the role of a quantitative professional in the organization. The book begins by looking at the need and demand for in-house trading platforms, addressing the current trends in the industry. It then looks at the trade life cycle and its participants, from beginning to end, and then the functions within the front, middle and back office, giving the reader a full understanding and appreciation of the perspectives and needs of each function. The book then moves on to platform design, addressing all the fundamentals of platform design, system architecture, programming languages and choices. Finally, the book focuses on some of the more technical aspects of platform design and looks at traditional and new languages and approaches used in modern quantitative development. The book is accompanied by a CD-ROM, featuring a fully working option pricing tool with source code and project building instructions, illustrating the design principles discussed, and enabling the reader to develop a mini-trading platform. The book is also accompanied by a website http://pqd.thulasidas.com that contains updates and companion materials.",0470745703,9780470745700,253,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_pigq2lyF68C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=_pigq2lyF68C&pg=PA198&dq=Finance&hl=&cd=115&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=_pigq2lyF68C&dq=Finance&hl=&source=gbs_api

International Finance,"H. Kent Baker, Leigh A. Riddick",Oxford University Press,2012-12-24,"Understanding the current state of affairs and tools available in the study of international finance is increasingly important as few areas in finance can be divorced completely from international issues. International Finance reflects the new diversity of interest in international finance by bringing together a set of chapters that summarizes and synthesizes developments to date in the many and varied areas that are now viewed as having international content. The book attempts to differentiate between what is known, what is believed, and what is still being debated about international finance. The survey nature of this book involves tradeoffs that inevitably had to be made in the process given the vast footprint that constitutes international finance. No single book can cover everything. This book, however, tries to maintain a balance between the micro and macro aspects of international finance. Although each chapter is self-contained, the chapters form a logical whole that follows a logical sequence. The book is organized into five broad categories of interest: (1) exchange rates and risk management, (2) international financial markets and institutions, (3) international investing, (4) international financial management, and (5) special topics. The chapters cover market integration, financial crisis, and the links between financial markets and development in some detail as they relate to these areas. In each instance, the contributors to this book discuss developments in the field to date and explain the importance of each area to finance as a field of study. Consequently, the strategic focus of the book is both broad and narrow, depending on the reader's needs. The entire book provides a broad picture of the current state of international finance, but a reader with more focused interests will find individual chapters illuminating on specific topics.",0199311501,9780199311507,1125,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KrKbQFl5j1gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,4.5,4,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=KrKbQFl5j1gC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Finance&hl=&cd=294&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KrKbQFl5j1gC&source=gbs_api

Foundations of Airline Finance,Bijan Vasigh,Routledge,2014-11-13,"In recent years the airline industry has experienced severe volatility in earnings, with airlines recording periods of substantial profits that are closely followed by periods of financial distress.

This new edition also includes: capital budgeting management of current assets financial risk analysis fuel hedging aircraft leasing This textbook contains chapters that cover unique aspects of the aviation financial decision-making process. These include a rigorous and structured presentation of the buy versus lease decision that is prevalent in the industry, a valuation process for aviation assets, the recent trend toward privatization and the difficulty inherent in the valuation of a publicly-owned or semi-publicly owned asset.

Finance and Development,"Christopher J. Green, Colin H. Kirkpatrick, Victor Murinde",Edward Elgar Publishing,2005,"In the last two decades, the role of finance in the development process has become a major topic of research and debate. Although it is widely agreed that there is an important link between the two, there is much less consensus on the exact nature of the relationship. Is financial development a prerequisite for general economic development, or is it a more passive by-product of the development process? In this valuable new book, a distinguished group of authors takes stock of the existing state of knowledge in the field of finance and the development process. Each chapter offers a comprehensive survey and synthesis of current issues. These include such critical subjects as savings, financial markets and the macroeconomy, stock market development, financial regulation, foreign investment and aid, financing livelihoods, microfinance, rural financial markets, small and medium enterprises, corporate finance and banking. This book will be accessible to postgraduate and advanced undergraduate students of finance and development.

Global Finance and Development,David Hudson,Routledge,2014-11-27,"The question of money, how to provide it, and how to acquire it where needed is axiomatic to development. The realities of global poverty and the inequalities between the ‘haves’ and the ‘have-nots’ are clear and well documented, and the gaps between world’s richest and the world’s poorest are ever-increasing. But, even though funding development is assumed to be key, the relationship between finance and development is contested and complex. This book explores the variety of relationships between finance and development, offering a broad and critical understanding of these connections and perspectives. It breaks finance down into its various aspects, with separate chapters on aid, debt, equity, microfinance and remittances. Throughout the text, finance is presented as a double-edged sword: while it is a vital tool towards poverty reduction, helping to fund development, more critical approaches remind us of the ways in which finance can hinder development. It contains a range of case studies throughout to illustrate finance in practice, including, UK aid to India, debt in Zambia, Apple’s investment in China, microfinance in Mexico, government bond issues in Chile, and financial crisis in East Asia. The text develops and explores a number of themes throughout, such as the relationship between public and private sources of finance and debates about direct funding versus the allocation of credit through commercial financial markets. The book also explores finance and development interactions at various levels, from the global structure of finance through to local and everyday practices. Global Finance and Development offers a critical understanding of the nature of finance and development. This book encourages the reader to see financial processes as embedded within the broader structure of social relationships. Finance is defined and demonstrated to be money and credit, but also, crucially, the social relationships and institutions that enable the creation and distribution of credit and the consequences thereof. This valuable text is essential reading for all those concerned with poverty, inequality and development.",1134612788,9781134612789,455,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1yacBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=1yacBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Finance&hl=&cd=392&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=1yacBQAAQBAJ&dq=Finance&hl=&source=gbs_api
Property Finance,"Giacomo Morri, Antonio Mazza",John Wiley & Sons,2014-11-06,"A unique, international approach to optimal real estate financing Property Finance is an authoritative guide to both the financial and legal issues surrounding real estate financing. Unique in its exclusive focus on the topic, this book builds from a solid theoretical foundation to provide practical tools and real-world solutions. Beginning with a discussion of the general issues encountered in real estate finance from an international perspective, the authors delve into country-specific information and set out the legal peculiarities of eight important countries (Germany, France, Italy, Spain, China, India, England and Wales) by asking questions of relevance to the leading local law firms specializing in real estate financing. The reader may thus consider in greater depth the problems relating to any given country and compare and contrast the positions under different legal systems. Examples with numerical calculations and contract excerpts enhance the explanations presented, and are immediately followed by practical case studies that illustrate the mechanisms at work. The companion website features downloadable spreadsheets used in the examples, power point presentations, as well as real estate news and more. Property financing entails many sources of capital, including both debt and equity resources as well as hybrid forms like preferred equity and mezzanine debt. Knowing how to work with these avenues is important to ensuring financial sustainability in real estate assets. Property Finance covers the most common issues encountered, helping readers prepare for and find a way around possible roadblocks. Consider the issues surrounding real estate lending at an international level Compare and contrast the positions under different legal systems Develop an international perspective on cash flows and financing agreements Use powerful tools to structure financing and gauge its effects on property financing The success of a real estate investment is dependent upon optimal financing, and a mere bird's eye view of the topic does not fully prepare investors for issues ahead: Property Finance provides a knowledge-based approach to real estate investment, detailed information and powerful tools.",1118764382,9781118764381,276,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mB8-BQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=mB8-BQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Finance&hl=&cd=393&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mB8-BQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Finance for Growing Enterprises,"Roger Buckland, Edward W. Davis",Routledge,2016-07-15,"This volume, originally published in 1995, examines the mechanisms by which businesses that have the capacity to grow – whether in terms of output, innovation or export – acquire the cash that enables growth. Addressing an issue of central importance to the competitiveness of firms and economies, this book draws together research by leading academics in the area. Throughout, research studies develop the themes of market failure, finance gaps and failure of demand. They also bring out the linkages between the financing choices facing the growing firm and the issues of organisation and of corporate governance that have to be address during the process of growth and maturity. Contributors challenge financial orthodoxy throughout, providing coherent analyses of the difficulties faced in the finance of the growing enterprise, from its early dependence on banks and informal finance to the pinnacle of a stock exchange listing.",1317191706,9781317191704,330,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MJKuDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=MJKuDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Finance&hl=&cd=409&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=MJKuDAAAQBAJ&dq=Finance&hl=&source=gbs_api

Beyond Greed and Fear,Hersh Shefrin,Oxford University Press,1999-09-15,"Even the best Wall Street investors make mistakes. No matter how savvy or experienced, all financial practitioners eventually let bias, overconfidence, and emotion cloud their judgement and misguide their actions. Yet most financial decision-making models fail to factor in these fundamentals of human nature. In Beyond Greed and Fear, the most authoritative guide to what really influences the decision-making process, Hersh Shefrin uses the latest psychological research to help us understand the human behavior that guides stock selection, financial services, and corporate financial strategy. Shefrin argues that financial practitioners must acknowledge and understand behavioral finance--the application of psychology to financial behavior--in order to avoid many of the investment pitfalls caused by human error. Through colorful, often humorous real-world examples, Shefrin points out the common but costly mistakes that money managers, security analysts, financial planners, investment bankers, and corporate leaders make, so that readers gain valuable insights into their own financial decisions and those of their employees, asset managers, and advisors. According to Shefrin, the financial community ignores the psychology of investing at its own peril. Beyond Greed and Fear illuminates behavioral finance for today's investor. It will help practitioners to recognize--and avoid--bias and errors in their decisions, and to modify and improve their overall investment strategies.",0198044399,9780198044390,403,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=99TQCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=99TQCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Finance&hl=&cd=414&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=99TQCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Islamic Banking and Finance,"Munawar Iqbal, David T. Llewellyn",Edward Elgar Publishing,2002-01-01,"It is a well-known fact that conventional commercial banks provide financial intermediation services on the basis of interest rates on assets and liabilities. However, since interest is prohibited in Islam, Islamic banks have developed several other modes through which savings are mobilized and passed on to entrepreneurs, none of which involve interest. Islamic Banking and Finance discusses Islamic financial theory and practice, and focuses on the opportunities offered by Islamic finance as an alternative method of financial intermediation. Key features of profit-sharing (as opposed to debt-based) contracts are highlighted, and the ways in which they can facilitate improved efficiency and stability of a financial system are explored. The authors illustrate that in addition to some 200 Islamic banks operating in Muslim as well as non-Muslim countries, some of the biggest multinational banks are now offering Islamic financial products. This book will fascinate students, researchers and academics with a special interest in comparative banking, middle-eastern studies and international finance, and will also appeal to practitioners of banking and finance.",1843765314,9781843765318,270,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4SPAfvIzAV4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=4SPAfvIzAV4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Finance&hl=&cd=416&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4SPAfvIzAV4C&source=gbs_api

"Continuous-Time Models in Corporate Finance, Banking, and Insurance","Santiago Moreno-Bromberg, Jean-Charles Rochet",Princeton University Press,2018-01-08,"Continuous-Time Models in Corporate Finance synthesizes four decades of research to show how stochastic calculus can be used in corporate finance. Combining mathematical rigor with economic intuition, Santiago Moreno-Bromberg and Jean-Charles Rochet analyze corporate decisions such as dividend distribution, the issuance of securities, and capital structure and default. They pay particular attention to financial intermediaries, including banks and insurance companies. The authors begin by recalling the ways that option-pricing techniques can be employed for the pricing of corporate debt and equity. They then present the dynamic model of the trade-off between taxes and bankruptcy costs and derive implications for optimal capital structure. The core chapter introduces the workhorse liquidity-management model—where liquidity and risk management decisions are made in order to minimize the costs of external finance. This model is used to study corporate finance decisions and specific features of banks and insurance companies. The book concludes by presenting the dynamic agency model, where financial frictions stem from the lack of interest alignment between a firm's manager and its financiers. The appendix contains an overview of the main mathematical tools used throughout the book. Requiring some familiarity with stochastic calculus methods, Continuous-Time Models in Corporate Finance will be useful for students, researchers, and professionals who want to develop dynamic models of firms' financial decisions.",1400889200,9781400889204,176,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PYc5DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=PYc5DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Finance&hl=&cd=418&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PYc5DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api
Behavioral Finance: The Coming Of Age,Itzhak Venezia,World Scientific,2019-04-18,"The area of behavioral finance, though relatively young, has matured and spread beyond its initial objectives: to demonstrate the fallibility of the efficient market hypothesis, to shake the belief in the ubiquity of rational decision making, and to convince the finance world of the importance of psychological biases in decision making. The success of the field in meeting its goals, however, has called into question its continued relevance. Behavioral finance is thus currently at a crossroads, and researchers need to decide which way they should turn for the area to continue to thrive and to meaningfully contribute to financial knowledge.This collection of papers deals with rarely-explored topics to point at new directions that behavioral finance should explore to maintain its viability, along with contributions to traditional topics. Some of these topics include innovations, the psychology of policy-makers, biases of peer-to-peer market participants, the behavior and motivation behind corporate social responsibility, and the design of exchanges. Additionally, well-known topics such as the disposition effect, slow and fast decisions and the availability heuristic are revisited, and surprising new findings are presented.By opening the field to novel avenues of discussion, this book addresses the future of behavioral finance and its transition into a new era.",9813279478,9789813279476,501,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WeaWDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=WeaWDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Finance&hl=&cd=419&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WeaWDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

The book is divided into three parts: Part 1 revisits important market risk issues, while Part 2 introduces novel concepts in credit risk and its management along with updated quantitative methods. The third part discusses the dynamics of risk management and includes risk analysis of energy markets and for cryptocurrencies. Digital assets, such as blockchain-based currencies, have become popular b ut are theoretically challenging when based on conventional methods. Among others, it introduces a modern text-mining method called dynamic topic modeling in detail and applies it to the message board of Bitcoins. The unique synthesis of theory and practice supported by computational tools is reflected not only in the selection of topics, but also in the fine balance of scientific contributions on practical implementation and theoretical concepts. This link between theory and practice offers theoreticians insights into considerations of applicability and, vice versa, provides practitioners convenient access to new techniques in quantitative finance. Hence the book will appeal both to researchers, including master and PhD students, and practitioners, such as financial engineers. The results presented in the book are fully reproducible and all quantlets needed for calculations are provided on an accompanying website. The Quantlet platform quantlet.de, quantlet.com, quantlet.org is an integrated QuantNet environment consisting of different types of statistics-related documents and program codes. Its goal is to promote reproducibility and offer a platform for sharing validated knowledge native to the social web. QuantNet and the corresponding Data-Driven Documents-based visualization allows readers to reproduce the tables, pictures and calculations inside this Springer book.",3662544865,9783662544860,369,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iZ4vDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,5,5,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=iZ4vDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Finance&hl=&cd=429&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iZ4vDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

The International Handbook of Shipping Finance,"Manolis G. Kavussanos, Ilias D. Visvikis",Springer,2016-11-10,"The International Handbook of Shipping Finance is a one-stop resource, offering comprehensive reference to theory and practice in the area of shipping finance. In the multibillion dollar international shipping industry, it is important to understand the various issues involved in the finance of the sector. This involves the identification and evaluation of the alternative sources of capital available for financing the ships, including the appraisal and budgeting of shipping investment projects; legal and insurance aspects of ship finance; the financial analysis and modelling of investment projects; mergers and acquisitions; and the commercial and market risk management issues involved. Edited by two leading academics in this area, and with contributions from 25 prominent market practitioners and academics over 16 chapters, this Handbook covers shipping finance and banking, maritime financial management and investments. As such, it includes: shipping markets; asset backed finance; shipbuilding finance; debt finance; public and private equity and debt markets; structured finance; legal aspects and key clauses of ship mortgages; marine insurance; mechanisms for handling defaulted loans; investment appraisal and capital budgeting; financial analysis and investment modelling; business risk management and freight derivatives; and mergers and acquisitions. Thus, the Handbook offers a rigorous understanding of the different aspects of modern shipping finance and maritime financial management and investments, the various characteristics of the available products, the capital needs and requirements, and a clear view on the different financial management strategies through a series of practical examples and applications. Technical where appropriate, but grounded in market reality, this is a “must-have” reference for anyone involved in shipping finance, from bank practitioners and commodity trading houses, to shipbrokers, lawyers and insurance houses as well as to university students studying shipping finance.

Capital and Finance,"Peter Lewin, Nicolás Cachanosky",Taylor & Francis,2020-07-02,"This book applies finance to the field of capital theory. While financial economics is a well-established field of study, the specific application of finance to capital theory remains unexplored. It is the first book to comprehensively study this financial application, which also includes modern financial tools such as Economic Value Added (EVA®). A financial application to the problem of the average period of production includes two discussions that unfold naturally from this application. The first one relates to the dual meaning of capital, one as a monetary fund and the other one as physical (capital) goods. The second concerns its implications for business-cycle theories. This second topic (1) provides a solid financial microeconomic foundation for business cycles and, also (2) makes it easy to compare different business-cycle theories across the average period of production dimension. By clarifying the obscure concept of average period of production, the authors make it easier to analyze the similarities with and differences from other business-cycle theories. By connecting finance with capital theory, they provide a new point of view and analysis of the long-standing problems in capital theory as well as other related topics such as the use of neoclassical production functions and theorizing about business cycles. Finally, they emphasize that the relevance of their application rests on both its policy implications and its contributions to contemporary economic theory.",0429633181,9780429633188,163,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=em4IEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=em4IEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Finance&hl=&cd=433&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=em4IEQAAQBAJ&dq=Finance&hl=&source=gbs_api

In the book, Baker, Singleton, and Velt do nothing less than provide an overview of survey methodology useful to financial researchers, synthesize the major streams or clusters of survey research in corporate finance, and offer a valuable resource and guide for those interested in conducting survey research in finance. Thus this volume will be an essential reference for practitioners, academics, and graduate students - who all must know the methodology of finance survey research. In addition to methodology, the book identifies areas that will be best served by survey-based research. Researchers will have a wealth of information regarding past surveys and will be aware of suitable candidates for future surveys.

Capitalizing on Crisis,Greta R. Krippner,Harvard University Press,2011-02-15,"In the context of the recent financial crisis, the extent to which the U.S. economy has become dependent on financial activities has been made abundantly clear. In Capitalizing on Crisis, Greta Krippner traces the longer-term historical evolution that made the rise of finance possible, arguing that this development rested on a broader transformation of the U.S. economy than is suggested by the current preoccupation with financial speculation. Krippner argues that state policies that created conditions conducive to financialization allowed the state to avoid a series of economic, social, and political dilemmas that confronted policymakers as postwar prosperity stalled beginning in the late 1960s and 1970s. In this regard, the financialization of the economy was not a deliberate outcome sought by policymakers, but rather an inadvertent result of the state’s attempts to solve other problems. The book focuses on deregulation of financial markets during the 1970s and 1980s, encouragement of foreign capital into the U.S. economy in the context of large fiscal imbalances in the early 1980s, and changes in monetary policy following the shift to high interest rates in 1979. Exhaustively researched, the book brings extensive new empirical evidence to bear on debates regarding recent developments in financial markets and the broader turn to the market that has characterized U.S. society over the last several decades.",0674050843,9780674050846,241,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-K4ktKx20w4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=-K4ktKx20w4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Finance&hl=&cd=446&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=-K4ktKx20w4C&dq=Finance&hl=&source=gbs_api
Theoretical Foundations of Corporate Finance,João Amaro de Matos,Princeton University Press,2018-06-05,"Corporate finance is the area of finance that studies the determinants of firms' values, including capital structure, financing, and investment decisions. Although there are several excellent texts in corporate finance, this is the first to focus on the theoretical foundations of the subject in a consistent and integrated way at the Ph.D. level. In addition to a textbook for advanced graduate students, it can also serve as a general reference to researchers and sophisticated practitioners. The material presented is carefully selected with an eye to what is essential to understanding the underlying theory, ensuring that this text will remain useful for years to come. The book is divided into three parts. The first section presents the basic principles of valuation based on the absence of arbitrage, including a discussion of the determinants of the optimal capital structure based on the seminal results of Modigliani and Miller. The second section discusses the implications of agency problems and information asymmetries to capital structure, giving particular attention to payout policy and to debt contract design. The concluding portion presents different ways of restructuring capital, including going public, going private using stock repurchases or leveraged buyouts, and mergers and acquisitions. Each chapter includes exercises that vary in difficulty, with suggested solutions provided in an appendix.

How Important are Financing Constraints?,"Meghana Ayyagari, Aslı Demirgüç-Kunt, Vojislav Maksimovic",World Bank Publications,2006,"What role does the business environment play in promoting and restraining firm growth? Recent literature points to a number of factors as obstacles to growth. Inefficient functioning of financial markets, inadequate security and enforcement of property rights, poor provision of infrastructure, inefficient regulation and taxation, and broader governance features such as corruption and macroeconomic stability are discussed without any comparative evidence on their ordering. In this paper, the authors use firm level survey data to present evidence on the relative importance of different features of the business environment. They find that although firms report many obstacles to growth, not all the obstacles are equally constraining. Some affect firm growth only indirectly through their influence on other obstacles, or not at all. Using Directed Acyclic Graph methodology as well as regressions, the authors find that only obstacles related to finance, crime, and political instability directly affect the growth rate of firms. Robustness tests further show that the finance result is the most robust of the three. These results have important policy implications for the priority of reform efforts. They show that maintaining political stability, keeping crime under control, and undertaking financial sector reforms to relax financing constraints are likely to be the most effective routes to promote firm growth.",N/A,N/A,68,Business enterprises,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vTiyAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=vTiyAAAAIAAJ&q=Finance&dq=Finance&hl=&cd=460&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=vTiyAAAAIAAJ&dq=Finance&hl=&source=gbs_api

The Best of Wilmott 1,Paul Wilmott,John Wiley & Sons,2005-07-08,"November 11th 2003 saw a landmark event take place in London. As the first conference designed for quants by quants the Quantitative Finance Review 2003, moved away from the anonymous bazaars that have become the norm, and instead delivered valuable information to market practitioners with the greatest interest. The roster of speakers was phenomenal, ranging from founding fathers to bright young things, discussing the latest developments, with a specific emphasis on the burgeoning field of credit derivatives. You really had to be there. Until now, at least. The Best of Wilmott 1: Including the latest research from Quantitative Finance Review 2003 contains these first-class articles, originally presented at the QFR 2003, along with a collection of selected technical papers from Wilmott magazine. In publishing this book we hope to share some of the great insights that, until now, only delegates at QFR 2003 were privy to, and give you some idea why Wilmott magazine is the most talked about periodical in the market. Including articles from luminaries such as Ed Thorp, Jean-Philippe Bouchaud, Philipp Schoenbucher, Pat Hagan, Ephraim Clark, Marc Potters, Peter Jaeckel and Paul Wilmott, this collection is a must for anyone working in the field of quantitative finance. The articles cover a wide range of topics: * Psychology in Financial Markets * Measuring Country Risk as Implied Volatility * The Equity-to-Credit Problem * Introducing Variety in Risk Management * The Art and Science of Curve Building * Next Generation Models for Convertible Bonds with Credit Risk * Stochastic Volatility and Mean-variance Analysis * Cliquet Options and Volatility Models And as they say at the end of (most) Bond movies The Best of Wilmott... will return on an annual basis.",047002352X,9780470023525,458,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=imGSCYliKAYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=imGSCYliKAYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Finance&hl=&cd=464&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=imGSCYliKAYC&source=gbs_api
Machine Learning in Finance,"Matthew F. Dixon, Igor Halperin, Paul Bilokon",Springer,2021-07-02,"This book introduces machine learning methods in finance. It presents a unified treatment of machine learning and various statistical and computational disciplines in quantitative finance, such as financial econometrics and discrete time stochastic control, with an emphasis on how theory and hypothesis tests inform the choice of algorithm for financial data modeling and decision making. With the trend towards increasing computational resources and larger datasets, machine learning has grown into an important skillset for the finance industry. This book is written for advanced graduate students and academics in financial econometrics, mathematical finance and applied statistics, in addition to quants and data scientists in the field of quantitative finance. Machine Learning in Finance: From Theory to Practice is divided into three parts, each part covering theory and applications. The first presents supervised learning for cross-sectional data from both a Bayesian and frequentist perspective. The more advanced material places a firm emphasis on neural networks, including deep learning, as well as Gaussian processes, with examples in investment management and derivative modeling. The second part presents supervised learning for time series data, arguably the most common data type used in finance with examples in trading, stochastic volatility and fixed income modeling. Finally, the third part presents reinforcement learning and its applications in trading, investment and wealth management. Python code examples are provided to support the readers' understanding of the methodologies and applications. The book also includes more than 80 mathematical and programming exercises, with worked solutions available to instructors.

It has done this on a model of finance that rejects interest and promotes profit sharing. How is this possible? Yet the wealth potential of Islamic finance is far from being its most attractive feature. What is most compelling about Islamic finance are its ethical principles and strong corporate governance based on Shariah law.

Trade and Receivables Finance,Stephen A. Jones,Palgrave Macmillan,2018-11-23,"Trade and Receivable Finance provides the definitive practical guide to the evaluation and mitigation of risk and the financing of international trade. This authoritative manual is built upon more than 42 years of experience in the trade and receivables finance market and carries the endorsement of The London Institute of Banking and Finance. The contents are comprehensive incorporating clause examples, specimen documents, financier checklists and diagrams. The traditional method of commercial lending assessment places primary importance on the ability of the borrower to repay the financier. However, this form of evaluation often results in insufficient credit appetite to release the required level of financial support for a company involved in cross border trade. When a trade-related proposition is properly evaluated so that the transactional risks are fully understood and mitigated to an acceptable level, and the source of repayment is identifiable and considered reliable, a well-structured trade and receivables finance facility reduces the risk of default when compared to conventional lending products and can generate additional credit appetite. This book will become a constant ‘go-to’ companion for transaction banking teams, bank relationship managers, specialist client-facing trade and invoice finance specialists, middle and back office trade advisory personnel, credit analysts, alternative market financiers, export development agencies and credit insurers. The techniques described in this book are applied to an extensive range of international trade scenarios inThe Trade and Receivables Finance Companion: A Collection of Case Studies and Solutions (Palgrave, 2020).",3319957341,9783319957340,0,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yYBBuAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,5,1,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=yYBBuAEACAAJ&dq=Finance&hl=&cd=469&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=yYBBuAEACAAJ&dq=Finance&hl=&source=gbs_api

Pension Fund Economics and Finance,Jacob Bikker,Routledge,2017-11-22,"Pension fund benefits are crucial for pensioners’ welfare and pension fund savings have accumulated to huge amounts, covering a major part of world-wide institutional investments. However, the literature on pension fund economics and finance is rather limited, caused, in part, to limited data availability. This book contributes to this literature and focuses on three important areas. The first is pension fund (in)efficiency, which has a huge impact on final benefits, particularly when annual spoilage accumulates over a lifetime. Scale economies, pension plans complexity and alternative pension saving plans are important issues. The second area is investment behavior and risk-taking. A key question refers to the allocation of investments over high risk/high return and relatively safe assets. Bikker investigates whether pension funds follow the life-cycle hypothesis: more risk and return for pension funds with young participants. Many pension funds are rather limited in size, which may raise the question how financially sophisticated the pension fund decision makers are: rather professionals or closer to unskilled private persons? The third field concerns two regulation issues. How do pension fund respond to shocks such as unexpected investment returns or changes in life expectancy? What are the welfare implications to the beneficiary for different methods of securing pension funding: solvency requirements, a pension guarantee fund, or sponsor support? This groundbreaking book will challenge the way pension fund economics is thought about and practiced.",1317220838,9781317220831,216,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=agZADwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=agZADwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Finance&hl=&cd=483&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=agZADwAAQBAJ&dq=Finance&hl=&source=gbs_api
"Discrete Time Series, Processes, and Applications in Finance",Gilles Zumbach,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-10-04,"Most financial and investment decisions are based on considerations of possible future changes and require forecasts on the evolution of the financial world. Time series and processes are the natural tools for describing the dynamic behavior of financial data, leading to the required forecasts. This book presents a survey of the empirical properties of financial time series, their descriptions by means of mathematical processes, and some implications for important financial applications used in many areas like risk evaluation, option pricing or portfolio construction. The statistical tools used to extract information from raw data are introduced. Extensive multiscale empirical statistics provide a solid benchmark of stylized facts (heteroskedasticity, long memory, fat-tails, leverage...), in order to assess various mathematical structures that can capture the observed regularities. The author introduces a broad range of processes and evaluates them systematically against the benchmark, summarizing the successes and limitations of these models from an empirical point of view. The outcome is that only multiscale ARCH processes with long memory, discrete multiplicative structures and non-normal innovations are able to capture correctly the empirical properties. In particular, only a discrete time series framework allows to capture all the stylized facts in a process, whereas the stochastic calculus used in the continuum limit is too constraining. The present volume offers various applications and extensions for this class of processes including high-frequency volatility estimators, market risk evaluation, covariance estimation and multivariate extensions of the processes. The book discusses many practical implications and is addressed to practitioners and quants in the financial industry, as well as to academics, including graduate (Master or PhD level) students. The prerequisites are basic statistics and some elementary financial mathematics.",3642317421,9783642317422,326,Mathematics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=n-j1QbkHnFUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=n-j1QbkHnFUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Finance&hl=&cd=484&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=n-j1QbkHnFUC&source=gbs_api

The Art of Islamic Banking and Finance,Yahia Abdul-Rahman,John Wiley & Sons,2009-12-09,"A detailed look at the fast-growing field of Islamic banking and finance The Art of Islamic Banking and Finance is a modern American take on what it means to incorporate Islamic finance principles into everyday banking and investment techniques by introducing a new brand of banking for all people of all faiths: The Riba-Free (RF) banking. The author is considered the father of RF (Islamic) banking in America. He has been a banker and an Imam/scholar for over 40 years in America since 1968. He started the tedious process with a finance company, LARIBA, in Pasadena, California in 1987. This is the first book ever in the field to trace the origins of prohibiting the renting of money at a price called interest rate and over-indulging in debt. The book reviews in great details the theological foundations of prohibiting interest in the Jewish Bible, the Christian Bible, and the Qur'aan. The author then discusses money and how fiat money is created, the role of the Federal Reserve, and the banking system in America. The book also discusses for the first time ever how to include an important aspect of RF (Islamic) finance using commodity indexation and marking the items to be financed to market in order to avoid participating in economic ""bubbles."" The author discusses how these rules work, how they affect consumer behavior, and how they change the role of the banker/financier. Covers a new pioneering model that is based on the Law (Shari'aa) and how it is applied in every transaction from joint ventures and portfolio management to home mortgages and personal financing Shows how to incorporate the Law (Shari'aa) into American financing and banking systems Points to RF (Islamic) finance and banking as a way to emphasize socially responsible investing The Art of Islamic Banking and Finance also includes a discussion on the emergence of a culture of RF (Islamic) banking and finance today, which is based on the real Judeo-Christian-Islamic spirit and very effective when compared to twentieth-century models that use financial engineering and structuring techniques to circumvent the Law (Shari'aa). The book also includes case studies based on the actual experience of the author and detailed analysis of the superior results realized by applying this new brand of banking to financing.",0470572612,9780470572610,435,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ticADEp6eLQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=ticADEp6eLQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Finance&hl=&cd=487&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=ticADEp6eLQC&dq=Finance&hl=&source=gbs_api

Corporate Finance Fundamentals,"Stephen A. Ross, Randolph W. Westerfield, Bradford D. Jordan",Irwin Professional Publishing,2008,"""The best-selling ""Fundamentals of Corporate Finance"" (""FCF"") is written with one strongly held principle that corporate finance should be developed and taught in terms of a few integrated, powerful ideas. As such, there are three basic themes that are the central focus of the book: an emphasis on intuition-underlying ideas are discussed in general terms and then by way of examples that illustrate in more concrete terms how a financial manager might proceed in a given situation; a unified valuation approach-net present value (NPV) is treated as the basic concept underlying corporate finance. Every subject covered is firmly rooted in valuation, and care is taken to explain how particular decisions have valuation effects; and a managerial focus - the authors emphasize the role of the financial manager as decision maker, and they stress the need for managerial input and judgment. The Eighth Edition continues the tradition of excellence that has earned ""Fundamentals of Corporate Finance"" its status as market leader. Every chapter has been updated to provide the most current examples that reflect corporate finance in today's world. The supplements package has also been updated and improved.

Creating Financial Value,Malcolm Allitt,Bloomsbury Publishing,2016-01-28,"How many senior executives and managers are able to reach the top with little or no financial training? They may have been appointed to the executive board as a result of their expertise in marketing, HR, sales or IT, yet every board member has a responsibility to make informed decisions on proposed financial actions - decisions which inevitably affect the value of their business. Offering straightforward and practical advice, Creating Financial Value will equip those who are not financial specialists with the necessary knowledge not only to contribute fully to important discussions on policy and strategy, but also to develop sound business proposals, or to competently cross-examine the proposals of others. Through examples from a range of business disciplines, the book explains in simple, digestible terms how a business creates financial value, and how a non-financial manager can confidently take an active role in the process. Once read, the book will provide an essential resource that can be referenced time and again. Malcolm Allitt punctures the myths surrounding 'shareholder value' and looks behind the finance jargon to define the boundaries between what a non-specialist should know and when it is good practice to seek the advice of financial specialists.

Statistical Coverage of Trade Finance - Fintechs and Supply Chain Financing,Cornelia Lotte van Wersch,International Monetary Fund,2019-07-31,"Trade finance is the backbone of international trade for entities ranging from a small businesses to multi-national corporations. An estimated 80 percent of world trade relies on this form of finance (WTO, 2017). Despite its systemic importance and rapid growth, data availability is only partial. During the 2008 financial crisis, policy makers, notably the G20 recognized that the absence of comprehensive trade finance data posed a significant hurdle for policy-makers to make informed, timely decisions.

Finance and Occupational Pensions,Charles Sutcliffe,Palgrave Macmillan,2016-12-29,"Occupational pensions are major participants in global financial markets with assets of well over $30 trillion, representing more than 40% of the assets of institutional investors. Some occupational pension funds control assets of over $400 billion, and the largest 300 occupational pension funds each have average assets of over $50 billion. The assets of UK pension funds are equivalent to UK GDP, and US pension fund assets are 83% of US GDP. These statistics highlight the importance of pension funds as major players in financial markets, and the need to understand the behaviour of these large institutional investors. Occupational pensions also play an important, but neglected, role in corporate finance. For example, US company pension schemes account for over 60% of company market value, and yet they are often ignored when analysing companies. This book is based on the substantial body of evidence available from around the world on a topic that has become increasingly importantand controversial in recent years. Written for practitioners, students and academics, this book brings together and systematizes a very large international literature from financial economists, actuaries, practitioners, professional organizations, official documents and reports. The underlying focus is the application of the principles of financial economics to occupational pensions, including the work of Nobel laureates such as Merton, Markowitz, Modigliani, Miller and Sharpe, as well as Black. This book will give readers an up-to-date understanding of occupational pensions, the economic issues they face, and some suggestions of how these issues can be tackled. The first section explains the operation of defined benefit and defined contribution pensions, along with some descriptive statistics. The second section covers selected aspects of occupational pensions. The focus of these first two sections is on the economic and financial aspects of pensions, accompanied by some basic information on how they operate. This is followed by three further sections that analyse the investment of pension funds, the corporate finance implications of firms providing pensions for their employees, and annuities.",1349948624,9781349948628,0,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=U48mjwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=U48mjwEACAAJ&dq=Finance&hl=&cd=505&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=U48mjwEACAAJ&dq=Finance&hl=&source=gbs_api
"Finance, Firm Size, and Growth",Thorsten Beck,World Bank Publications,2005,"""The authors examine whether financial development boosts the growth of small firms more than large firms and hence provides information on the mechanisms through which financial development fosters aggregate economic growth. They define an industry's technological firm size as the firm size implied by industrial specific production technologies, including capital intensities and scale economies. Using cross-industry, cross-country data, the results indicate that financial development exerts a disproportionately large effect on the growth of industries that are technologically more dependent on small firms. This suggests that financial development accelerates economic growth by removing growth constraints on small firms and also implies that financial development has sectoral as well as aggregate growth ramifications.

"Finance, Law, and the Crisis of COVID-19","Nadia Mansour, Lorenzo M. Bujosa Vadell",Springer,2023-02-20,"This book analyzes the impact of Covid-19 in different areas such as corporate social responsibility and legislation in SMEs, insolvency law, behavioral finance, government interventions in markets, financial disclosure, the emergence of unregulated financial sectors, the increase of coronavirus-related crimes, and the development of banking regulations in the Covid-19 pandemic, among others. The coronavirus epidemic, which has spread throughout the world, has highlighted the inadequacies of the health and social systems of all states, even the most advanced. The health emergency has required extraordinary measures, especially at the level of laws that are essential for the preservation of lives, health, and livelihoods. The priority for governments and even the international community was, from the outset, to prevent infections and care for those affected. Such a strategy required an unusual increase in health spending, even though it exceeded the State's financial capacity and lacked fiscal space. In addition to this challenge, which has not yet been overcome, there is another, that of redressing the consequences of the measures taken (general containment). It should be pointed out that during health crises, the state may have to review the requirement for transparency because of the emergency, but not free itself from it. The urgency could never be an alibi for a violation of citizens' rights and freedoms. With urgency, financial management systems must be flexible and responsive to all occurrences, while ensuring optimal use of resources and minimizing the risks of fraud and corruption.",3030894185,9783030894184,0,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=V2ymzwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=V2ymzwEACAAJ&dq=Finance&hl=&cd=513&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=V2ymzwEACAAJ&dq=Finance&hl=&source=gbs_api

New Challenges in Entrepreneurship and Finance,"Marta Peris-Ortiz, Jean-Michel Sahut",Springer,2014-10-24,"Since the 2008 economic crisis, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have faced serious financial problems and have been looking to financial institutions and governments for solutions and new proposals to address these issues. This book examines the new challenge in which firms receive sustainable funding that is in alignment with the company’s spending capacity. The purpose of this book is to examine the main theoretical issues and practices regarding entrepreneurship and finance and their impact on performance, innovation and economic growth. It analyzes the fundamental aspects of entrepreneurship and studies ways in which financial institutions can better fulfill their primary function of feeding capital to businesses and the economy as a whole. Entrepreneurship and finance are fundamental to achieving success in economic and social activities. SMEs’ existence and development depend on the initiatives of entrepreneurship and access to resources, especially those of a financial nature. During the recent economic crisis, several new financing instruments have appeared, especially with structures designed for helping SMEs make their way out of the recession.

On the Role of Paradigms in Finance,Kavous Ardalan,Routledge,2016-05-13,"Social theory can usefully be conceived in terms of four key paradigms: functionalist, interpretive, radical humanist and radical structuralist. The four paradigms are founded upon different assumptions about the nature of society and each generates distinctive theories, concepts and analytical tools. Finance theory is based on the functionalist paradigm and for the most part finance theorists are unaware of the philosophical tradition to which they belong. By relating finance to the four paradigms, Ardalan's work offers a concise understanding of the multifaceted nature of finance. He recommends theorists adopt a diversity of paradigms and discusses its benefits by application to the following phenomena: the development of academic finance, the mathematical language of academic finance, the mathematics of academic finance, money, corporate governance, markets, technology and education.",1317085728,9781317085720,191,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ac8oDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=ac8oDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Finance&hl=&cd=519&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ac8oDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api
Routledge Handbook of Social and Sustainable Finance,Othmar M. Lehner,Routledge,2016-06-23,"Routledge Handbook of Social and Sustainable Finance brings together an international cast of leading authorities to map out and display the disparate voices, traditions and professional communities engaged in social finance activity. With a clear societal or environmental mission, foundations, individual and group investors, as well as public bodies around the world have become increasingly eager to finance and support innovative forms of doing business. Together, founders and established businesses alike are embracing new sustainable business models with a distinct stakeholder approach to tackle social or environmental problems in what they see as a failed economic system in crisis. As a result, the topic of social and sustainable finance is at the forefront of financial economic thought. This Handbook is divided up into three parts. The first, ""The Landscape of Social and Sustainable Finance and Investments"", comprises of chapters from a multitude of perspectives in an effort to grasp the entirety of the landscape. The second, ""Challenges, Suggestions, Critiques and Debates"", focuses on areas ranging from sociological underpinnings to critical takes on markets, and the identification of specialized business models. Amongst ethical considerations, topics include the scaling of impact, an analysis of sustainability as risk prevention and comparative analyses of various methods of justification and measurement. In the third and final section, ""Markets and Institutions"", contributions range from various perspectives on sustainable banking to environmental marketplaces, and finally on to practical cases and country specific observations.

Al Bhimani, distinguished accountant, academic, and author, shows readers how established business fundamentals are being eclipsed and that accounting has not been spared. You'll learn: How the new realities of digitalization, including big data and AI, are affecting audit work and financial management practices How learning fast about and from more diverse data sources is essential to the new accounting environment Why accounting information must start to speak to what will take place rather than about financial activities that have occurred What finance must do in a world of changing risks, data growth, fast digitization, and increased regulation The author makes a compelling case that accounting now faces a crunch: it needs to reshape itself from the core because conventional financial analysis is proving too cumbersome and slow for executives in digitalized organizations. In a straightforward and illustrated style packed with case studies and practical examples, he shows readers how big data, blockchain, robotic process automation, and artificial intelligence, can help accountants adapt to new realities.

Airline Finance,Peter S. Morrell,Routledge,2018-05-02,"Air transport industry finance, with its complexity and special needs such as route rights, airport slots, aircraft leasing options and frequent flyer programmes, requires specific knowledge. While there are numerous financial management and corporate finance texts available, few of these provide explanations for the singularities of the airline industry with worked examples drawn directly from the industry itself. Revised and updated in its fourth edition, this internationally renowned and respected book provides the essentials to understanding all areas of airline finance. Designed to address each of the distinct areas of financial management in an air transport industry context, it also shows how these fit together, while each chapter and topic provides a detailed resource which can be also consulted separately. Supported at each stage by practical airline examples, it examines the financial trends and prospects for the airline industry as a whole, contrasting the developments for the major regions and airlines. Important techniques in financial analysis are applied to the airline industry, together with critical discussion of key issues. Thoroughly amended and updated throughout, the fourth edition reflects the many developments that have affected the industry, with a particular emphasis on the full impact of the global banking and sovereign debt crises. This edition also features new material discussing the increased airline mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity of recent years, and considers the likelihood of further consolidation in the future. The book is a key resource for students of airline management, and a sophisticated and authoritative guide for analysts in financial institutions and consultancies, executives in airlines and related industries, and civil aviation departments.",1351959743,9781351959742,356,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ql1ZDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=Ql1ZDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Finance&hl=&cd=523&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=Ql1ZDwAAQBAJ&dq=Finance&hl=&source=gbs_api

Public Finance and National Accounts in the European Context,Joaquim Miranda Sarmento,Springer,2019-01-31,"This book offers an essential guide to Public Finance and National Accounts in the context of the European Union. Since the creation of the Eurozone, fiscal policy has been at the heart of economic (but also political/media) discussions in the EU. From the Stability and Growth Pact (1997) to the more recent Fiscal Treaty, EU and Eurozone, countries have been subject to various fiscal rules. The importance of these rules, and of the subsequent procedures that every Eurozone country has to adhere to, is unquestionable. The book provides the reader with an in-depth understanding of the complex EU rules concerning fiscal policy, breaking down the corresponding legal texts into simple and accessible language.

"Introduction to Stochastic Calculus Applied to Finance, Second Edition","Damien Lamberton, Bernard Lapeyre",CRC Press,2007-11-30,"Since the publication of the first edition of this book, the area of mathematical finance has grown rapidly, with financial analysts using more sophisticated mathematical concepts, such as stochastic integration, to describe the behavior of markets and to derive computing methods.

Islamic Banking and Finance in the European Union,"M. Fahim Khan, Mario Porzio",Edward Elgar Publishing,2010-01-01,"As an introduction to the complex issue of harmonization of legal and regulatory structure of the European financial system and Islamic finance, this is a useful and welcome volume. The ideas, insights and practical issues addressed in the informed papers that compose the book should be valuable for academics and students of finance, and to those who provide legal and financial services. The book will be helpful also to European regulators who have yet to appreciate the importance of Islamic finance and its potential contribution to financial globalization as well as to European economic growth. Abbas Mirakhor, Former Executive Director, International Monetary Fund, US This timely book examines the authorization of Shari ah-compliant intermediaries as either credit institutions or as investment companies in the European Union. The contributing authors explore the key topics of this area through differing yet parallel perspectives for example, comparing economic and legal standpoints, looking at both European and national levels and considering both academic and technical approaches. The book discusses the common origin of Islamic and Western traditions in commercial and banking transactions, reviewing a period in which the Italian merchants and their organizations drove the rebirth of post-medieval society in trade and law. The editors investigate whether the Islamic banking and financial model complies with the European framework, spelling out the different experiences in single Member States (Germany, France, Italy, and the United Kingdom). Notwithstanding the obstacles to being authorized as domestic credit institutions, they conclude that the access of Islamic intermediaries is suitable and may have positive effects on European integration, as well as increasing the competition among the stand-still operators and evoking the ethical dimension of banking and finance. The book also highlights how Islamic banking would make the industry more inclusive. This multidisciplinary book will appeal greatly to economics and legal scholars with an interest in European and international banking and financial law, as well as postgraduate students in international law and banking law. Practitioners and regulators will also find this book an invaluable resource.",1849803412,9781849803410,253,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oPstuILq5B4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,4.5,2,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=oPstuILq5B4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Finance&hl=&cd=570&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oPstuILq5B4C&source=gbs_api

"Finance, a Christian Perspective",Pierre de Lauzun,N/A,2021-06-18,"This book, perhaps startlingly, is about finance from a Christian point of view, taking its start from the Gospels and moving forward to modern Catholic Social Teaching and today's opaque money markets, pausing along the way to delve into the origins of finance in the Christian Middle Ages. Not only those with a Christian orientation, but anyone looking for a coherent, moral view of finance will profit from its keen insights. Markets represent free, responsible interaction among human beings, and for this reason their functioning cannot escape close scrutiny in view of moral duty and the common good-precisely the sort of scrutiny this work offers in abundance. As former CEO of financial institutions, Chairman of the French Association of Catholic Economists, member of the French Catholic Academy, seasoned financial practitioner, and scholar of Catholic social teaching, Pierre de Lauzun is uniquely suited to this task.

Global Finance at Risk,"John Eatwell, Lance Taylor",N/A,2000,"In Global Finance at Risk, two acclaimed economists propose a bold and necessary solution to the financial crises that threaten us all: a World Financial Authority with powers to establish best-practice financial regulation and risk management everywhere. The expansion of finance in industrialized economies, including nineteenth-century Britain and the United States, saw exactly the same kind of turbulence now afflicting Asia, Russia and Latin America. Then, the solution was to establish national banking and securities regulators, deposit insurance and lenders of last resort. But in our increasingly globalized world, the savings account you open at your local bank can be based on bad debt from anywhere in the world, including places outside the jurisdiction of those national agencies. And when banks fail, it is not just their account-holders who suffer, but all of us. This is why, argue John Eatwell and Lance Taylor in this timely and urgent book, effective regulation of the international financial system is crucial for the economic health of all nations. Global Finance at Risk presents a compelling case for the international regulation of world financial systems. Written in a clear and accessible style and addressing one of the most critical issues in the world today, this is a book which deserves to be widely read and discussed.",0745625118,9780745625119,258,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dcD-PgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=dcD-PgAACAAJ&dq=Finance&hl=&cd=588&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=dcD-PgAACAAJ&dq=Finance&hl=&source=gbs_api
Banking and Finance in West Germany (RLE Banking & Finance),"Hans Francke, Michael Hudson",Routledge,2013-05-02,"This is a clear guide to the German financial system. It begins by outlining its historical development, emphasising the growth of close ties between the banking system and industry, and goes on to describe in details the nature of the credit institutions in general and the money and capital markets. The book emphasizes the crucial role played by the autonomy of the Bundesbank and it explains with clear illustrations the instruments available to it to conduct monetary policy. It analyses the type of monetary target adopted by the Bundesbank in the early 1970s and deals with the ‘transferability’ of the West German financial system to other countries. Wherever relevant, parallels and differences between that system and the ones operating in the US and UK are pointed out.",1136301259,9781136301254,147,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NitjwSHc80EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=NitjwSHc80EC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Finance&hl=&cd=589&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=NitjwSHc80EC&dq=Finance&hl=&source=gbs_api
Introduction to Quantitative Finance,Robert R. Reitano,MIT Press,2010-01-29,"An introduction to many mathematical topics applicable to quantitative finance that teaches how to “think in mathematics” rather than simply do mathematics by rote. This text offers an accessible yet rigorous development of many of the fields of mathematics necessary for success in investment and quantitative finance, covering topics applicable to portfolio theory, investment banking, option pricing, investment, and insurance risk management. The approach emphasizes the mathematical framework provided by each mathematical discipline, and the application of each framework to the solution of finance problems. It emphasizes the thought process and mathematical approach taken to develop each result instead of the memorization of formulas to be applied (or misapplied) automatically. The objective is to provide a deep level of understanding of the relevant mathematical theory and tools that can then be effectively used in practice, to teach students how to “think in mathematics” rather than simply to do mathematics by rote. Each chapter covers an area of mathematics such as mathematical logic, Euclidean and other spaces, set theory and topology, sequences and series, probability theory, and calculus, in each case presenting only material that is most important and relevant for quantitative finance. Each chapter includes finance applications that demonstrate the relevance of the material presented. Problem sets are offered on both the mathematical theory and the finance applications sections of each chapter. The logical organization of the book and the judicious selection of topics make the text customizable for a number of courses. The development is self-contained and carefully explained to support disciplined independent study as well. A solutions manual for students provides solutions to the book's Practice Exercises; an instructor's manual offers solutions to the Assignment Exercises as well as other materials.",026201369X,9780262013697,747,Mathematics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JYX6AQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=JYX6AQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Finance&hl=&cd=590&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=JYX6AQAAQBAJ&dq=Finance&hl=&source=gbs_api
A Matter of Trust,"Paul Kofman, Clare Payne",Melbourne University,2018-02-26,"From the marble trading floors of Wall Street to the dirt floor of a microfinance lender in rural Sumatra, finance touches everybody's lives. From small personal loans to collateralised debt obligations, it promises solutions for a better, more prosperous future. But not much in life is guaranteed, and financial outcomes may not match consumer expectations. When trust between practitioners and their clients is undermined it threatens the very fabric of our financial system. The result can be personal disappointment, but the financial crisis of 2007-08 highlighted how we can all be affected when economies are jeopardised by financial mismanagement.

International Finance and Open-Economy Macroeconomics,Giancarlo Gandolfo,Springer,2016-07-22,"This rigorous textbook tames technicalities and makes even the most complex models accessible to students. Its unique two-tier structure makes the book attractive for undergraduates, graduates and researchers alike. In fact, the coverage is primarily directed to undergraduate students and is mainly confined to graphic analysis and to some elementary algebra. Further, each chapter has its own mathematical appendix, in which (i) the topics treated in the text are examined at a level suitable for advanced undergraduates, graduates and researchers, and (ii) generalizations and/or topics not treated in the text (including some at the cutting edge of research) are formally examined. The new edition has been thoroughly revised and updated to reflect the latest research on international finance. This book deals with the financial side of international economics and covers all aspects of international finance. There are many books and articles by exponents of alternative points of view. I know of no other book that provides the scope, balance, objectivity and rigor of this book. the late Professor Jerome L. Stein, Brown University This book is a second edition of a volume on international finance first published in 2001. Like Giancarlo’s other books in International Economics, this book is organised as a two-books-in-one by distributing the material between text and appendices. The text provides coverage suitable for an undergraduate course while the mathematical appendices provide coverage of the topics at the frontier of the discipline and suitable for advanced undergraduate or graduate students in an international finance and international macroeconomics course. This edition updates the earlier volume and covers all the classic topics as well as the more recent advances in the theory and modelling of international finance. It includes some discussion of the empirical testing of these theories and where appropriate reference to the extensive empirical literature is also provided. This book is a valuable addition to the bookshelf of any serious International Finance Scholar and provides a treasure chest of material for any quality international finance course. Professor Pasquale M Sgro, Deakin University Giancarlo Gandolfo is one of the profession's most gifted textbook authors on mathematical modeling and international economics. His revised International Finance and Open-Economy Macroeconomics is remarkable for its scope and clarity. The book covers the older and intertemporal approaches, and topics that are usually left out of graduate treatments (the chapter on balance-of-payments accounting is a gem). Gandolfo's two-tier approach of first developing topics with graphs and basic algebra and then providing rigorous mathematics for each topic makes the book ideal for advanced undergraduate and graduate classes.

Discrete-time Asset Pricing Models in Applied Stochastic Finance,P. C. G. Vassiliou,John Wiley & Sons,2013-03-01,"Stochastic finance and financial engineering have been rapidly expanding fields of science over the past four decades, mainly due to the success of sophisticated quantitative methodologies in helping professionals manage financial risks. In recent years, we have witnessed a tremendous acceleration in research efforts aimed at better comprehending, modeling and hedging this kind of risk. These two volumes aim to provide a foundation course on applied stochastic finance. They are designed for three groups of readers: firstly, students of various backgrounds seeking a core knowledge on the subject of stochastic finance; secondly financial analysts and practitioners in the investment, banking and insurance industries; and finally other professionals who are interested in learning advanced mathematical and stochastic methods, which are basic knowledge in many areas, through finance. Volume 1 starts with the introduction of the basic financial instruments and the fundamental principles of financial modeling and arbitrage valuation of derivatives. Next, we use the discrete-time binomial model to introduce all relevant concepts. The mathematical simplicity of the binomial model also provides us with the opportunity to introduce and discuss in depth concepts such as conditional expectations and martingales in discrete time. However, we do not expand beyond the needs of the stochastic finance framework. Numerous examples, each highlighted and isolated from the text for easy reference and identification, are included. The book concludes with the use of the binomial model to introduce interest rate models and the use of the Markov chain model to introduce credit risk. This volume is designed in such a way that, among other uses, makes it useful as an undergraduate course.",1118618661,9781118618660,296,Mathematics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=v7ZAl7HsgC8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=v7ZAl7HsgC8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Finance&hl=&cd=620&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=v7ZAl7HsgC8C&source=gbs_api

Data Mining in Finance,"Boris Kovalerchuk, Evgenii Vityaev",Springer,2013-03-29,"Data Mining in Finance presents a comprehensive overview of major algorithmic approaches to predictive data mining, including statistical, neural networks, ruled-based, decision-tree, and fuzzy-logic methods, and then examines the suitability of these approaches to financial data mining. The book focuses specifically on relational data mining (RDM), which is a learning method able to learn more expressive rules than other symbolic approaches. RDM is thus better suited for financial mining, because it is able to make greater use of underlying domain knowledge. Relational data mining also has a better ability to explain the discovered rules - an ability critical for avoiding spurious patterns which inevitably arise when the number of variables examined is very large. The earlier algorithms for relational data mining, also known as inductive logic programming (ILP), suffer from a relative computational inefficiency and have rather limited tools for processing numerical data. Data Mining in Finance introduces a new approach, combining relational data mining with the analysis of statistical significance of discovered rules. This reduces the search space and speeds up the algorithms. The book also presents interactive and fuzzy-logic tools for `mining' the knowledge from the experts, further reducing the search space. Data Mining in Finance contains a number of practical examples of forecasting S&P 500, exchange rates, stock directions, and rating stocks for portfolio, allowing interested readers to start building their own models. This book is an excellent reference for researchers and professionals in the fields of artificial intelligence, machine learning, data mining, knowledge discovery, and applied mathematics.",1475773315,9781475773316,308,Computers,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FyQAswEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=FyQAswEACAAJ&dq=Finance&hl=&cd=622&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=FyQAswEACAAJ&dq=Finance&hl=&source=gbs_api

Divested,"Ken-Hou Lin, Megan Tobias Neely",Oxford University Press,2019-12-04,"Finance is an inescapable part of American life. From how one pursues an education, buys a home, runs a business, or saves for retirement, finance orders the lives of ordinary Americans. And as finance continues to expand, inequality soars. In Divested, Ken-Hou Lin and Megan Tobias Neely demonstrate why widening inequality cannot be understood without examining the rise of big finance. The growth of the financial sector has dramatically transformed the American economy by redistributing resources from workers and families into the hands of owners, executives, and financial professionals. The average American is now divested from a world driven by the maximization of financial profit. Lin and Neely provide systematic evidence to document how the ascendance of finance on Wall Street, Main Street, and among households is a fundamental cause of economic inequality. They argue that finance has reshaped the economy in three important ways. First, the financial sector extracts resources from the economy at large without providing economic benefits to those outside the financial services industry. Second, firms in other economic sectors have become increasingly involved in lending and investing, which weakens the demand for labor and the bargaining power of workers. And third, the escalating consumption of financial products by households shifts risks and uncertainties once shouldered by unions, corporations, and governments onto families. A clear, comprehensive, and convincing account of the forces driving economic inequality in America, Divested warns us that the most damaging consequence of the expanding financial system is not simply recurrent financial crises but a widening social divide between the have and have-nots.",019063832X,9780190638320,241,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gMHADwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=gMHADwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Finance&hl=&cd=625&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gMHADwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api
Machine Learning and AI in Finance,"German Creamer, Gary Kazantsev, Tomaso Aste",Routledge,2021-04-06,"The significant amount of information available in any field requires a systematic and analytical approach to select the most critical information and anticipate major events. During the last decade, the world has witnessed a rapid expansion of applications of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms to an increasingly broad range of financial markets and problems. Machine learning and AI algorithms facilitate this process understanding, modelling and forecasting the behaviour of the most relevant financial variables. The main contribution of this book is the presentation of new theoretical and applied AI perspectives to find solutions to unsolved finance questions. This volume proposes an optimal model for the volatility smile, for modelling high-frequency liquidity demand and supply and for the simulation of market microstructure features. Other new AI developments explored in this book includes building a universal model for a large number of stocks, developing predictive models based on the average price of the crowd, forecasting the stock price using the attention mechanism in a neural network, clustering multivariate time series into different market states, proposing a multivariate distance nonlinear causality test and filtering out false investment strategies with an unsupervised learning algorithm. Machine Learning and AI in Finance explores the most recent advances in the application of innovative machine learning and artificial intelligence models to predict financial time series, to simulate the structure of the financial markets, to explore nonlinear causality models, to test investment strategies and to price financial options.

Public-Private Partnerships,E. R. Yescombe,Elsevier,2011-04-01,"Over the last decade or so, private-sector financing through public-private partnerships (PPPs) has become increasingly popular around the world as a way of procuring and maintaining public-sector infrastructure, in sectors such as transportation (roads, bridges, tunnels, railways, ports, airports), social infrastructure (hospitals, schools, prisons, social housing) public utilities (water supply, waste water treatment, waste disposal), government offices and other accommodation, and other specialised services (communications networks or defence equipment). This book, based on the author's practical experience on the public- and private-sector sides of the table, reviews the key policy issues which arise for the public sector in considering whether to adopt the PPP procurement route, and the specific application of this policy approach in PPP contracts, comparing international practices in this respect. It offers a systematic and integrated approach to financing PPPs within this public-policy framework, and explains the project-finance techniques used for this purpose. The book deals with both the Concession and PFI models of PPP, and provides a structured introduction for those who are new to the subject, whether in the academic, public-sector, investment, finance or contracting fields, as well as an aide memoire for those developing PPP policies or negotiating PPPs. The author focuses on practical concepts, issues and techniques, and does not assume any prior knowledge of PPP policy issues or financing techniques. The book describes and explains:* The different types of PPPs and how these have developed* Why PPPs are attractive to governments* General policy issues for the public sector in developing a PPP programme* PPP procurement procedures and bid evaluation* The use of project-finance techniques for PPPs* Sources of funding* Typical PPP contracts and sub-contracts, and their relationship with the project's financial structure * Risk assessment from the points of view of the public sector, investors, lenders and other project parties* Structuring the investment and debt financing* The key issues in negotiating a project-finance debt facility.

Introductory Stochastic Analysis for Finance and Insurance,"X. Sheldon Lin, Society of Actuaries",John Wiley & Sons,2006-04-21,"Incorporates the many tools needed for modeling and pricing infinance and insurance Introductory Stochastic Analysis for Finance and Insuranceintroduces readers to the topics needed to master and use basicstochastic analysis techniques for mathematical finance. The authorpresents the theories of stochastic processes and stochasticcalculus and provides the necessary tools for modeling and pricingin finance and insurance. Practical in focus, the book's emphasisis on application, intuition, and computation, rather thantheory. Consequently, the text is of interest to graduate students,researchers, and practitioners interested in these areas. While thetext is self-contained, an introductory course in probabilitytheory is beneficial to prospective readers. This book evolved from the author's experience as an instructor andhas been thoroughly classroom-tested. Following an introduction,the author sets forth the fundamental information and tools neededby researchers and practitioners working in the financial andinsurance industries: * Overview of Probability Theory * Discrete-Time stochastic processes * Continuous-time stochastic processes * Stochastic calculus: basic topics The final two chapters, Stochastic Calculus: Advanced Topics andApplications in Insurance, are devoted to more advanced topics.Readers learn the Feynman-Kac formula, the Girsanov's theorem, andcomplex barrier hitting times distributions. Finally, readersdiscover how stochastic analysis and principles are applied inpractice through two insurance examples: valuation of equity-linkedannuities under a stochastic interest rate environment andcalculation of reserves for universal life insurance. Throughout the text, figures and tables are used to help simplifycomplex theory and pro-cesses. An extensive bibliography opens upadditional avenues of research to specialized topics. Ideal for upper-level undergraduate and graduate students, thistext is recommended for one-semester courses in stochastic financeand calculus. It is also recommended as a study guide forprofessionals taking Causality Actuarial Society (CAS) and Societyof Actuaries (SOA) actuarial examinations.",0471793205,9780471793205,224,Mathematics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cW7rYX6ATw0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=cW7rYX6ATw0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Finance&hl=&cd=645&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cW7rYX6ATw0C&source=gbs_api

The Economics of Government,Vito Tanzi,Oxford University Press,2020-10-02,"Public finance is an important branch of economics. Over the years it has become more important, more controversial, and more complex. Much of the academic writing on it is highly theoretical, and it is often done by economists who have had little real world experience. Vito Tanzi has been continually engaged in this field for almost six decades, as a professor of public finance, a practitioner of it in many countries, and as a researcher, and has witnessed first-hand the growing gap between theoretical work and the real life practice of public finance. Public finance has come to be increasingly influenced by the pursuit of multiple government goals and by the growing complexity that now characterizes fiscal policy and government programs in many countries. Notably, the goal of simplicity has played only a small role in the practice of public finance and in academic work. Complexity puts a dense fog around many policies, making it difficult to predict and assess the results. This book aims to highlight to both economists and policymakers the need for simplicity in policies. It also aims to inform students of public finance and public policy about this growing problem and the need to pay more attention to it.",0192636324,9780192636324,241,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HVEAEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=HVEAEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Finance&hl=&cd=649&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HVEAEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api
The Interval Market Model in Mathematical Finance,"Pierre Bernhard, Jacob C. Engwerda, Berend Roorda, J.M. Schumacher, Vassili Kolokoltsov, Patrick Saint-Pierre, Jean-Pierre AUBIN",Birkhäuser,2015-01-28,"Toward the late 1990s, several research groups independently began developing new, related theories in mathematical finance. These theories did away with the standard stochastic geometric diffusion “Samuelson” market model (also known as the Black-Scholes model because it is used in that most famous theory), instead opting for models that allowed minimax approaches to complement or replace stochastic methods. Among the most fruitful models were those utilizing game-theoretic tools and the so-called interval market model. Over time, these models have slowly but steadily gained influence in the financial community, providing a useful alternative to classical methods. A self-contained monograph, The Interval Market Model in Mathematical Finance: Game-Theoretic Methods assembles some of the most important results, old and new, in this area of research. Written by seven of the most prominent pioneers of the interval market model and game-theoretic finance, the work provides a detailed account of several closely related modeling techniques for an array of problems in mathematical economics. The book is divided into five parts, which successively address topics including: · probability-free Black-Scholes theory; · fair-price interval of an option; · representation formulas and fast algorithms for option pricing; · rainbow options; · tychastic approach of mathematical finance based upon viability theory. This book provides a welcome addition to the literature, complementing myriad titles on the market that take a classical approach to mathematical finance. It is a worthwhile resource for researchers in applied mathematics and quantitative finance, and has also been written in a manner accessible to financially-inclined readers with a limited technical background.",1489985808,9781489985804,0,Mathematics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Oem3oAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=Oem3oAEACAAJ&dq=Finance&hl=&cd=650&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=Oem3oAEACAAJ&dq=Finance&hl=&source=gbs_api
Reforming Collateral Laws to Expand Access to Finance,Heywood W. Fleisig,World Bank Publications,2006,"Most readers, especially those with car loans or home mortgages, know about ""collateral""--property that the lender can take away from the borrower in the event that the borrower defaults. In low/middle income countries, it is understood that conservative lenders exclude firms from credit markets with their excessive collateral requirements. Usually, this is because only some property is acceptable as collateral: large holdings of urban real estate and, sometimes, new motor vehicles. Microenterprises, SMEs, and the poor have little of this property but they do have an array of productive assets that could easily be harnessed to serve as collateral. It is only the legal framework which prevents firms from using these assets to secure loans. In countries with reformed laws governing collateral, property such as equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, livestock are considered excellent collateral. This book aims to better equip project managers to implement reforms to the legal and institutional framework for collateral (secured transactions). It discusses the importance of movable property as a source of collateral for firms, the relationship between the legal framework governing movable assets and the financial sector consequences for firms (better loan terms, increased access, more competitive financial sector), and how reforms can be put in place to change the lending environment.",082136491X,9780821364918,120,Law,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rXO0VfSPxj8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=rXO0VfSPxj8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Finance&hl=&cd=651&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=rXO0VfSPxj8C&dq=Finance&hl=&source=gbs_api

Democratizing Finance,"Fred Block, Robert Hockett",Verso Books,2022-02-08,"What if our financial system were organized to the benefit of the many rather than simply empowering the few? Robert Hockett and Fred Block argue that an entirely different financial system is both desirable and possible. They outline concrete steps that could get us there. Financial systems move the worlds savings from investment to investment, chasing the highest rates of return. They run on profit. But what if investment went to the enterprises or institutions that provided things that the majority of people would prioritize? Democratizing Finance includes six responses that seek to amend, elaborate, and challenge the arguments developed by Hockett and Block.

Al-Thani",Wiley-Blackwell,2010-08-16,"Project finance has spread worldwide and includes numerous industrial projects from power stations and waste-disposal plants to telecommunication facilities, bridges, tunnels, railway networks, and now also the building of hospitals, education facilities, government accommodation and tourist facilities. Despite financial assessment of PF projects being fundamental to the lender’s decision, there is little understanding of how the use of finance is perceived by individual stakeholders; why and how a financial assessment is performed; who should be involved; where and when it should be performed; what data should be used; and how financial assessments should be presented. Current uncertainty in financial markets makes many sponsors of construction project financings carefully consider bank liquidity, the higher cost of finance, and general uncertainty for demand. This has resulted in the postponement of a number of projects in certain industry sectors. Governments have seen tax receipts drastically reduced which has affected their ability to finance infrastructure projects, often irrespective of the perceived demand. Equity providers still seek to invest, however there are less opportunities due to market dislocation. Due to the demand for global infrastructure it is believed that project financings will return to their pre-crunch levels, or more so, however lenders’ liquidity costs will be passed on to the borrowers. Lenders will also be under stricter regulation both internally and externally. The steps outlined in the guide are designed to provide a basic understanding for all those involved or interested in both structuring and assessing project financings. Secondary contracts involving constructors, operators, finance providers, suppliers and offtakers can be developed and assessed to determine their commercial viability over a projects life cycle. Special Features a structured guide to assessing the commercial viability of construction projects explains economic metrics to use in the decision making process detailed case study shows how stakeholders apply the concept of project finance",1444334778,9781444334777,192,Technology & Engineering,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RKnxtwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=RKnxtwAACAAJ&dq=Finance&hl=&cd=665&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=RKnxtwAACAAJ&dq=Finance&hl=&source=gbs_api

An important element of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), financial inclusion has been given significant prominence in reform and development agendas proposed by the United Nations and G-20.

"Crypto-Finance, Law and Regulation",Joseph Lee,Routledge,2022-02-17,"Crypto-Finance, Law and Regulation investigates whether crypto-finance will cause a paradigm shift in regulation from a centralised model to a model based on distributed consensus. This book explores the emergence of a decentralised and disintermediated crypto-market and investigates the way in which it can transform the financial markets. It examines three components of the financial market – technology, finance, and the law – and shows how their interrelationship dictates the structure of a crypto-market. It focuses on regulators’ enforcement policies and their jurisdiction over crypto-finance operators and participants. The book also discusses the latest developments in crypto-finance, and the advantages and disadvantages of crypto-currency as an alternative payment product. It also investigates how such a decentralised crypto-finance system can provide access to finance, promote a shared economy, and allow access to justice. By exploring the law, regulation and governance of crypto-finance from a national, regional and global viewpoint, the book provides a fascinating and comprehensive overview of this important topic and will appeal to students, scholars and practitioners interested in regulation, finance and the law.",0429657315,9780429657313,215,Law,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=caxVEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,5,9,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=caxVEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Finance&hl=&cd=669&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=caxVEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Ruling Capital,Kevin P. Gallagher,Cornell University Press,2015-02-10,"In Ruling Capital, Kevin P. Gallagher demonstrates how several emerging market and developing countries (EMDs) managed to reregulate cross-border financial flows in the wake of the global financial crisis, despite the political and economic difficulty of doing so at the national level. Gallagher also shows that some EMDs, particularly the BRICS coalition, were able to maintain or expand their sovereignty to regulate cross-border finance under global economic governance institutions. Gallagher combines econometric analysis with in-depth interviews with officials and interest groups in select emerging markets and policymakers at the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organization, and the G-20 to explain key characteristics of the global economy. Gallagher develops a theory of countervailing monetary power that shows how emerging markets can counter domestic and international opposition to the regulation of cross-border finance. Although many countries were able to exert countervailing monetary power in the wake of the crisis, such power was not sufficient to stem the magnitude of unstable financial flows that continue to plague the world economy. Drawing on this theory, Gallagher outlines the significant opportunities and obstacles to regulating cross-border finance in the twenty-first century.",0801454611,9780801454615,248,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=B7hIDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=B7hIDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Finance&hl=&cd=675&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=B7hIDwAAQBAJ&dq=Finance&hl=&source=gbs_api
Human Rights and Public Finance,"Aoife Nolan, Rory O'Connell, Colin Harvey",Bloomsbury Publishing,2014-10-01,"This edited collection addresses some of the most important challenges in contemporary human rights law and practice. Its central theme is the linkage between public finance, particularly budget decisions, and the realisation (or not) of economic and social rights. While much academic and political debate on economic and social rights implementation has focused on the role of the courts, this work places the spotlight squarely on those organs of government that have the primary responsibility and the greatest capacity for giving effect to such rights: namely, the elected branches of government. The major actors considered in this book are politicians, public servants and civil society, with their role in realising economic and social rights the work's key focus. The book thus makes a crucial contribution to remedying the current imbalance in attention paid by economic and social rights scholars to the legislature and executive vis-a-vis the judiciary.

Checkbook Elections?,"Pippa Norris, Andrea Abel van Es",N/A,2016,"Money is essential to the functioning of electoral politics, yet regulating its appropriate use raises complex and controversial challenges in countries around the world. Both long-established democracies and emerging economies have been continually plagued by problems of financial malfeasance, graft, corruption, and cronyism. To throw new light on these important challenges, this book addresses three related questions: (1) what types of public policies are commonly used in attempts to regulate the role of money in politics?, (2) what triggers landmark finance reforms? and, (3) above all, what works, what fails, and why - when countries implement reforms? Checkbook Elections? presents an original theory for understanding policies regulating political finance, reflecting the degree to which laws are laissez-faire or guided by state intervention.

Numerical Methods in Computational Finance,Daniel J. Duffy,John Wiley & Sons,2022-03-14,"This book is a detailed and step-by-step introduction to the mathematical foundations of ordinary and partial differential equations, their approximation by the finite difference method and applications to computational finance. The book is structured so that it can be read by beginners, novices and expert users. Part A Mathematical Foundation for One-Factor Problems Chapters 1 to 7 introduce the mathematical and numerical analysis concepts that are needed to understand the finite difference method and its application to computational finance. Part B Mathematical Foundation for Two-Factor Problems Chapters 8 to 13 discuss a number of rigorous mathematical techniques relating to elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations in two space variables. In particular, we develop strategies to preprocess and modify a PDE before we approximate it by the finite difference method, thus avoiding ad-hoc and heuristic tricks. Part C The Foundations of the Finite Difference Method (FDM) Chapters 14 to 17 introduce the mathematical background to the finite difference method for initial boundary value problems for parabolic PDEs. It encapsulates all the background information to construct stable and accurate finite difference schemes. Part D Advanced Finite Difference Schemes for Two-Factor Problems Chapters 18 to 22 introduce a number of modern finite difference methods to approximate the solution of two factor partial differential equations. This is the only book we know of that discusses these methods in any detail. Part E Test Cases in Computational Finance Chapters 23 to 26 are concerned with applications based on previous chapters. We discuss finite difference schemes for a wide range of one-factor and two-factor problems. This book is suitable as an entry-level introduction as well as a detailed treatment of modern methods as used by industry quants and MSc/MFE students in finance.

Financial and Accounting Principles in Islamic Finance,Samir Alamad,N/A,2019,"This book provides an original account detailing the origins and components of a faith-based accounting system that was founded around 629 CE. By examining the historical development that the accounting systems underwent within the context of faith-based rules and values, the book explains what is meant by the term ""faith-based accounting"", together with a discussion of its characteristics in relation to various product structures and the underlying Islamic finance principles. It provides important theoretical and practical contributions by explaining accounting as a value-based science rather than a value-free object or abstract. This book explores the way in which religious rules act as a directive for accounting and auditing practices in IFIs. Through which the concept of money and digital currency within the theory of money and how it is enacted in a faith-based context, amid differences of opinions among its actors, is examined. This is an important foundation to explain Islamic accounting and includes how this outcome would shape the faith-based view regarding the new phenomenon of digital currency (DC). Also featured is the concept of paper money within the theory of money and how it is enacted in a faith-based legal framework by identifying two core concepts of today's Fiat money as being a single genus or multi-genera money. This book is not merely an academic work, nor is it a pure practitioner guide; rather, it is a robust work that combines both. It marries rigorous academic research and theories with practical industry experiences.

Pound Foolish,Helaine Olen,National Geographic Books,2013-12-31,"If you’ve ever bought a personal finance book, watched a TV show about stock picking, listened to a radio show about getting out of debt, or attended a seminar to help you plan for your retirement, you’ve probably heard some version of these quotes: “What’s keeping you from being rich? In most cases, it is simply a lack of belief.” —SUZE ORMAN, The Courage to Be Rich “Are you latte-ing away your financial future?” —DAVID BACH, Smart Women Finish Rich “I know you’re capable of picking winning stocks and holding on to them.” —JIM CRAMER, Mad Money They’re common refrains among personal finance gurus. There’s just one problem: those and many simi­lar statements are false. For the past few decades, Americans have spent billions of dollars on personal finance products. As salaries have stagnated and companies have cut back on benefits, we’ve taken matters into our own hands, embracing the can-do attitude that if we’re smart enough, we can overcome even daunting financial obstacles. But that’s not true. In this meticulously reported and shocking book, journalist and former financial columnist Helaine Olen goes behind the curtain of the personal finance industry to expose the myths, contradictions, and outright lies it has perpetuated. She shows how an industry that started as a response to the Great Depression morphed into a behemoth that thrives by selling us products and services that offer little if any help. Olen calls out some of the biggest names in the business, revealing how even the most respected gurus have engaged in dubious, even deceitful, prac­tices—from accepting payments from banks and corporations in exchange for promoting certain prod­ucts to blaming the victims of economic catastrophe for their own financial misfortune. Pound Foolish also disproves many myths about spending and saving, including: Small pleasures can bankrupt you: Gurus popular­ized the idea that cutting out lattes and other small expenditures could make us millionaires. But reduc­ing our caffeine consumption will not offset our biggest expenses: housing, education, health care, and retirement. Disciplined investing will make you rich: Gurus also love to show how steady investing can turn modest savings into a huge nest egg at retirement. But these calculations assume a healthy market and a lifetime without any setbacks—two conditions that have no connection to the real world. Women need extra help managing money: Product pushers often target women, whose alleged financial ignorance supposedly leaves them especially at risk. In reality, women and men are both terrible at han­dling finances. Financial literacy classes will prevent future eco­nomic crises: Experts like to claim mandatory sessions on personal finance in school will cure many of our money ills. Not only is there little evidence this is true, the entire movement is largely funded and promoted by the financial services sector. Weaving together original reporting, interviews with experts, and studies from disciplines ranging from behavioral economics to retirement planning,Pound Foolish is a compassionate and compelling book that will change the way we think and talk about our money.",159184679X,9781591846796,0,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sDuQEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,5,1,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=sDuQEAAAQBAJ&dq=Finance&hl=&cd=688&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=sDuQEAAAQBAJ&dq=Finance&hl=&source=gbs_api

With crypto and fintech now threatening to transform finance in destabilizing and anti-democratic ways, and with China and other nations now digitizing their national currencies in the form of CBDCs that make the US dollar and national payments infrastructure look ever more quaint and outmoded, this book shows both why the US and other democratic commercial societies must, and how they can, democratically digitize their currencies, their national payments systems, and the authorities that respectively issue and administer them – in the US, the Federal Reserve System (‘the Fed’).",3030995666,9783030995669,211,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DqF5EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=DqF5EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Finance&hl=&cd=690&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DqF5EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api
