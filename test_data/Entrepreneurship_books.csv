Entrepreneurship,"Wojciech W. Gasparski, Stefan Kwiatkowski, Leo V. Ryan, CSV",Transaction Publishers,2011-12-31,"Entrepreneurship is the capability to be an entrepreneur. Beyond that idea is an ideology that a person's business actions result in industrial growth or technical advances, making that person a leader in the economic world. The contributors to this latest volume in the Praxiology Series, now available in paperback, are united in claiming that resourcefulness is a characteristic of people who take effective action, and that effectiveness is dependent on good, ethical purposes. The wide-angle definition of entrepreneurship presented in this volume demands that people and organizations engage in more than simple self-interest, but also display awareness of the prospects for wider growth and advances resulting from their decisions. In a period of financial crisis caused by irresponsible behavior by eminent would-be ""entrepreneurs"" the significance of this perspective should be evident. The editors claim that growth, not stagnation, advantage, not decline, are irreversible traits of business activity. This is why the very concept of entrepreneurship calls for values and responsibility—even more than in the past. The contributors develop the idea of entrepreneurship from both theoretical approaches religious and practical, or applied perspectives. This inter- and multidisciplinary approach offers readers a chance to rebuild trust in entrepreneurship.",1412815320,9781412815321,319,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BCrTUsAk_c0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=BCrTUsAk_c0C&pg=PA85&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BCrTUsAk_c0C&source=gbs_api

Teaching Entrepreneurship,"Peter van der Sijde, Annemarie Ridder, Gerben Blaauw, Christoph Diensberg",Springer Science & Business Media,2008-09-08,"“Entrepreneurship that is something you learn in practice”. “Entreprene- ship is learning by doing”. This is often heard when you tell others that you teach entrepreneurship, but maybe entrepreneurship is more “doing by learning”. Nevertheless, in entrepreneurship practice and theory are int- woven. For this reason the Learning Cycle introduced by Kolb (1984) is an often used teaching approach. According to this Learning Cycle there are four phases (“cycle”) that are connected: 1. Concrete experience (“doing”, “experiencing”) 2. Reflection (“reflecting on the experience”) 3. Conceptualization (“learning from the experience”) 4. Experimentation (“bring what you learned into practice”) In teaching you can enter this cycle at any stage, depending on the students. And that brings us to the different types of students. Based on Hills et al. (1998) a plethora of student groups can be distinguished (of course this list is not exhaustive), e.g: Ph.D. students, who do a doctoral programme in Entrepreneurship; the emphasis is on theory/science. DBA students, who do a doctoral programme that is, in comparison to the Ph.D. more practice oriented. MBA students, who take entrepreneurship as one of the courses in their programme. Most of the time MBA students are mature students, who after some work experience return to the university; the programme is practice oriented.",3790820385,9783790820386,133,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JX--xc_pIM0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=JX--xc_pIM0C&pg=PA118&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=8&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JX--xc_pIM0C&source=gbs_api

Handbook of Qualitative Research Methods in Entrepreneurship,"Helle Neergaard, John P. Ulhøi",Edward Elgar Publishing,2007,". . . the Handbook of Qualitative Research Methods in Entrepreneurship is an important contribution to the field, and should be referenced in any paper using qualitative methodologies to investigate the entrepreneurial phenomenon. Craig S. Galbraith, Journal of Enterprising Communities There is no hiding behind the ramparts of dry scholarship here. The credibility of the theory being spoken of is not the stuff of constructed proofs, but alignments of critical insight and utility. This is where qualitative work can make a difference to the field, and where this book makes its mark. Robin Holt, International Journal of Entrepreneurial Behaviour and Research The Handbook of Qualitative Research Methods in Entrepreneurship is an unusually solid and multifaceted book on what qualitative methods have done, are doing and will do in entrepreneurship research. Every serious entrepreneurship scholar should read it. It points at the future! Björn Bjerke, University of Kalmar, Sweden I would warmly recommend this unique collection of qualitative methods of entrepreneurship research to both mature and beginning researchers as a menu to choose from for their planned empirical studies. For those who try to get away from only quantitative studies in both business practice and academic research, this book is their chance to find a rich inspiration in reflecting on entrepreneurship as a lived experience using grounded theory and ethnographic, discourse and narrative approaches. It might convince editors of top journals of entrepreneurship research to welcome qualitative research submissions as an indispensable complement to quantitative only submissions. This domain is not physics. In bringing together such a variety of experts from so many nationalities in this Handbook, our Danish colleagues are making entrepreneurship research a realistic global venture. Jan Ulijn, Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands Helle Neergaard and John Parm Ulhøi have compiled a remarkable collection of work that both represents the range of methods and demonstrates the depth of insight that can be achieved through qualitative approaches. This book is not simply a handbook of qualitative research methods, though it well achieves this aim, it is also an important contribution towards the field of entrepreneurship research. From the Foreword by Sara Carter This expansive and practical Handbook introduces the methods currently used to increase the understanding of the usefulness and versatility of a systematic approach to qualitative research in entrepreneurship. It fills a crucial gap in the literature on entrepreneurship theory, and, just as importantly, illustrates how these principles and techniques can be appropriately and fruitfully employed. The Handbook is underpinned by the belief that qualitative research has the potential to charter hitherto unexplored waters in the field of entrepreneurship and thus contribute significantly to its further advancement. The contributors seek to assist entrepreneurship researchers in making more informed choices and designing more rigorous and sophisticated studies. They achieve this by providing concrete examples of research experiences and tangible how to advice. By clarifying what these research methods entail, how they are currently being used and how they can be evaluated, this Handbook constitutes a comprehensive and highly accessible methodological toolbox. Dealing with both well-accepted qualitative approaches and lesser-known, rarer and more novel approaches to the study of entrepreneurship, this Handbook will be invaluable to those studying, researching and teaching entrepreneurship.",1847204384,9781847204387,517,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MRbX7pc-PnUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,4,2,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=MRbX7pc-PnUC&pg=PA30&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=17&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MRbX7pc-PnUC&source=gbs_api

Researching Entrepreneurship,Per Davidsson,Springer Science & Business Media,2005-06-21,"Entrepreneurship is a phenomenon of tremendous societal importance. It is also an elusive phenomenon, and researching entrepreneurship is therefore fun, fascinating—and frustrating at times. In Researching Entrepreneurship, one of the most highly recognized entrepreneurship scholars shares in a personal and readable way his rich experience and ideas on how entrepreneurship can or should be researched. After a comprehensive treatment of entrepreneurship as societal phenomenon and scholarly domain, the core chapters of the book discuss design, sampling, operationalization and analysis issues on several levels of analysis: individual, venture, firm, industry, region and nation. The author provides numerous examples of problems and solutions from real research projects, as well as experienced-based suggestions for further improvements in future work. The book is targeted primarily at doctoral students and other (relative) newcomers to the field of entrepreneurship research. However, taking a fresh, reflective perspective and looking beyond research conventions, it should provide potential for inspiration and food for thought also for experienced entrepreneurship researchers. Moreover, while the examples are taken from entrepreneurship research, the book provides a unique ""experienced empirical researcher"" (rather than ""textbook method expert"") treatment of issues that are of equal relevance across the social sciences. This goes for topics such as the role of theory; qualitative vs. quantitative research; validity checking; statistical inference, and replication. Per Davidsson is Professor in Entrepreneurship at Brisbane Graduate School of Management, QUT, Australia, and Jönköping International Business School, Sweden. He is also Chair of the Research Committee of the Entrepreneurship Division of the (American) Academy of Management.",0387257012,9780387257013,236,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZFRDDf3PZLwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=ZFRDDf3PZLwC&pg=PA6&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=23&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=ZFRDDf3PZLwC&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&source=gbs_api

Extraordinary Entrepreneurship,Stephen C. Harper,John Wiley & Sons,2006-12-13,"The 21st Century brings all new rules. Entrepreneurs are challenging conventional wisdom and thinking outside the box. One of the first challenges involves challenging the assumption that a business has to be big to be successful. While most of the 20th century heralded big businesses, it is clear that businesses no longer have to be big to do big business. Now it is possible for a handful of people to operate a global business from virtually any place on the planet. Today, the keyboard has overtaken the boardroom. Financial markets, alliances, and joint ventures have eliminated the need for entrepreneurs to put up substantial capital investments. Today's businesses are driven by ideas, innovation, and execution.

Regional Dimensions of Entrepreneurship,Rolf Sternberg,Now Publishers Inc,2009,"Regional Dimensions of Entrepreneurship reviews the theoretical arguments supporting the idea that entrepreneurial activities and entrepreneurial success are influenced by the attributes of the region where the potential founder and the real founder of a firm was or actually is located. The author explains that the regional environment is an important context variable and cannot be ignored when exploring the determinants of firm creation and of new firm growth. Regional Dimensions of Entrepreneurship consists of the theoretical foundations, empirical evidence and policy implications for the importance of regional issues. Finally, the author provides an overview of the literature on regional entrepreneurship, covering as many countries and sub-national regions as possible, with a certain focus on Western Europe and North America due in part to the particularly large quantity of empirical research on regional entrepreneurship and regionally focused entrepreneurship policies in these areas.",1601982224,9781601982223,144,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=o046DriPaXsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=o046DriPaXsC&pg=PA105&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=31&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=o046DriPaXsC&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&source=gbs_api
Sustainable Innovation and Entrepreneurship,Rolf Wüstenhagen,Edward Elgar Publishing,2008-01-01,"When I received the review copy I was rather excited. . . the book as a collection of research papers that, in themselves, are very interesting, and provide a fast-track into the literature of the subject in question. . . it is a worthwhile purchase to support thinking on entrepreneurship and innovation in a world where the sustainability agenda is increasingly becoming the agenda for inventors, entrepreneurs and those who fund them or invest in their companies. . . All the papers are well written and scholarly. . . A particularly strong feature of the chapters is the range of sources quoted at the end of each chapter. These references provide pathways into many different literatures that might save much time for subsequent researchers. Lorraine Warren, International Journal of Entrepreneurial Behaviour and Research In recent years our understanding of corporate sustainability has moved from exploitation to exploration, from corporate environmental management to sustainable entrepreneurship, and from efficiency to innovation. Yet current trends indicate the need for radical innovation via entrepreneurial start-ups or new ventures within existing corporations despite difficulties with the financing and marketing of such efforts. Presenting both conceptual and empirical research, this fascinating book addresses how we can combine environmental and social sustainability with economic sustainability in order to produce innovative new business models. The international cast of contributors addresses the wide range of issues in the balance between growth and environmental concerns. The first five chapters discuss various aspects of sustainable entrepreneurship. This is followed by two chapters that look at innovation within existing firms. Innovation is not successful until it finds a customer, so the two chapters that follow delve into the marketing aspects of business-to-consumer and business-to-business settings. The book closes with a broad discussion of the evolution and future of the research agenda into the intersection of sustainability, innovation and entrepreneurship.

(De)mobilizing the Entrepreneurship Discourse,"Frederic Bill, Anders W. Johansson",Edward Elgar Publishing,2010-01-01,"This book is a banquet for readers who are open to a broader menu of ideas and insights into the nature of entrepreneurship, how it occurs, and the circumstances by which it manifests itself. By seeing the phenomenon of entrepreneurship in new and intriguing ways, the authors in this book helped me re-imagine the many different kinds of entrepreneurships that exist. I m very impressed with the creativity and scope of this book, and the cleverness of these scholars to bring so many delicious perspectives to the table. A book that is challenging and enjoyable to read. William B. Gartner, Clemson University, US This unique and fascinating book takes a critical look at aspects of the prevalent entrepreneurship discourse and presents several substantive new theories, prescribing what should be abandoned (demobilization) and what should be adopted or given a more central position (mobilization). The contributors contend that entrepreneurship is not only an economic matter; that it is not a predominantly male-gender issue; and that it is not only done by heroes or extraordinary efforts but rather that it is as much a matter of ordinary, routine activities. They conclude that the entrepreneurship literature could greatly benefit from including the concepts of space and place, that resistance to it is an important aspect of its success, and that it is just as much about imitation as about creativity. Finally, they address the issue that what should be demobilized or mobilized in the entrepreneurship discourse might actually be the wrong question, since entrepreneurship is arguably a way of life. At the cutting edge of entrepreneurship research, this thought-provoking book will prove a stimulating read for entrepreneurship academics, students and researchers in the fields of entrepreneurship and business and management.",1849806454,9781849806459,265,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mhktCaLUAV0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=mhktCaLUAV0C&pg=PA237&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=38&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mhktCaLUAV0C&source=gbs_api

Frontiers in Entrepreneurship,Boris Urban,Springer Science & Business Media,2010-07-23,"Te series Perspectives in Entrepreneurship: A Research Companion provides an authoritative overview of specialised themes in entrepreneurship. Each of the four books presents the conceptual framework and foundations underlying a specialist feld of scholarship in entrepreneurship. Te series is inspired by the dearth of higher-level texts available in South Africa, failing to encapsulate the rigorous research evident in the growing feld of entrepreneurship internationally. Te content is driven by a judicious selection and interpretation of key knowledge set in context by introducing and delineating major topics previously not discussed in-depth in traditional entrepreneurial texts. A blend of theoretical and empirical evidence is presented that collectively demonstrates the convergence of thinking on a particular theme. Identifying and evaluating the most seminal and impactful scholarly research on diferent subject areas where entrepreneurship is at the core, serves to achieve this convergence. By applying a theoretical lens to central issues ‘about entrepreneurship’ rather than focusing on practical issues of ‘how to’, the series has a conceptual outlook with specialist areas in detailed narrative. Te book is deliberately structured to add value to learners who are undertaking secondary programmes in entrepreneurship by building on basic entrepreneurship principles and theory. Te series builds on fundamental entrepreneurial texts.

Successful Entrepreneurship,Mirjam van Praag,Edward Elgar Publishing,2005-01-01,"Higher employment, economic growth and innovation are fundamental objectives of modern economies. One effective means of attaining these goals is the development of successful entrepreneurs, and this book aims to provide a deeper, research-based understanding of the factors influencing successful entrepreneurship. Mirjam van Praag compares and contrasts the economic theory of entrepreneurship with determinants of successful entrepreneurship derived from empirical evidence, in an attempt to discover what makes for an accomplished entrepreneur. The author's state-of-the-art historical, theoretical and empirical research on successful entrepreneurship - all from a explicit economic perspective - comprehensively addresses questions such as: 'What are the factors that influence individuals' decisions to start a business venture as opposed to working as an employee?' and 'What are the individual characteristics that make one successful as an entrepreneur?' thereby supporting or dispelling various existing myths. Individual factors contributing to the success of entrepreneurs that are considered include, amongst others, human capital, financial capital and psychological traits.

Entrepreneurship,Robert A. Baron,Edward Elgar Publishing,2012,"The early years of the 21st Century could well be called the 'decade(s) of the entrepreneur'. Entrepreneurship is an often-featured topic in magazine and newspaper articles, popular television shows and major films. Universities have added courses, departments, and even schools of entrepreneurship to their catalogs, and governments at all levels are competing to develop programs to encourage entrepreneurship. A key reason behind this growing interest is the widely held belief supported by economic data that entrepreneurship is a powerful engine of economic growth. By presenting accurate knowledge about entrepreneurship itself, this book serves to convert the rising tide of interest in entrepreneurship into advice and guidance that can actually assist entrepreneurs in achieving their goals. This book presents valid information concerning the factors that encourage entrepreneurship's emergence, including the conditions that shape its outcomes and how it unfolds as a process. This text draws on two key sources of knowledge input from entrepreneurs and the findings of empirical research obtained through systematic research. As the sub-title suggests, however, emphasis is placed on the latter whenever possible because the information individual entrepreneurs possess cannot readily serve as the basis for general principles or guidelines since it is unique to each entrepreneur. By combining evidence-based knowledge with the hard-earned wisdom of experienced entrepreneurs, this volume offers a balanced and inclusive guide useful to both current and aspiring entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurship is indeed a driving force of economic growth. But beyond that, it is also a key mechanism through which human creativity, ingenuity, skill, and energy are converted into tangible outcomes that can, and often do, change the world in ways that enhance and enrich human welfare. This volume will be of particular interest to students of entrepreneurship in a broad array of fields ranging from business and management to engineering and governance. Suitable for undergraduate courses and graduate programs alike, this book is frontier blazing in its own right and will help those who read it be so as well.",1781000387,9781781000380,241,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BJ5jLRKNhggC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,3,1,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=BJ5jLRKNhggC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=62&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BJ5jLRKNhggC&source=gbs_api

Especially universities are increasingly challenged to fulfill their third mission of commercialization. Technology transfer from science to industry is broadly based as it ranges from consultancy to the creation of spin-offs, which is the most visible form of technology transfer from science to industry. One opportunity to facilitate technology transfer in terms of spin-off creation is to establish technology transfer offices at research institutions to support scientists in creating spin-offs. Despite the fact, that research has made important contributions regarding the influence of scientist’s individual characteristics on spin-off creation, literature is still lacking regarding the influence of TTOs on scientist’s propensity to create a spin-off. In my work I am trying to provide first insights into the perception of TTOs by scientists and which aspects of consultancy offered by TTOs are of most importance for academic entrepreneurs during the creation of a spin-off.",3668374708,9783668374706,32,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=q-DWDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=q-DWDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA4&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=66&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=q-DWDQAAQBAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&source=gbs_api

Cooper, Purdue University, US 'Professor Scott Shane provides a deep and comprehensive discussion of the individual-opportunity nexus in entrepreneurship. Eschewing the usual approaches of either focusing exclusively on the individuals and their motivations and actions or focusing exclusively, almost always ex-post, on the economic potential of opportunities, Scott Shane fixes his gaze squarely on the nexus of the individual and the opportunity.

Entrepreneurship,"John R.

This book is designed to go beyond the nuts and bolts of entrepreneurship and help students develop the critical foundation referred to as “entrepreneurial thinking.” Organized to align with the typical flow of development, the text allows students to develop their own ideas alongside each lesson. Coverage of goals, opportunities, and resources includes detailed discussion of venture funding, financial resources, and the relationships needed to get an idea off of the ground; subsequent chapters include clear guidance on keeping the momentum going through product development, enterprise growth, value creation, and the evolution of the business model.

Innovation and Entrepreneurship,"Elias G. Carayannis, Elpida T. Samara, Yannis L. Bakouros",Springer,2014-10-29,"This book aims to meet the needs of education and training in modern techniques of innovation and entrepreneurship, and focuses on the detailed presentation of successful business practices. As today's global economic landscape is changing rapidly, the ability of businesses to introduce new products and services to the market faster than their competitors is perhaps their most distinct competitive advantage. This becomes obvious by the significant market share that the most innovative companies gain while increasing profitability. Extensive research in this field has demonstrated that companies that are constantly innovating normally double their profits compared to others. Moreover, establishing successful practices and policies of innovation management, through which ideas evolve from conception through evaluation to implementation and commercialization, become the basis for economic growth at the firm, industry, national, regional, and global levels. Taking Greece as an example, this volume identifies systemic weaknesses in development of new products, risk capital, patenting, broadband penetration, lifelong training, investment in research on the part of firms, high-tech exports, and employment in medium-high-technology manufacturing that place the country at the bottom of the European Union in economic performance and threaten its potential to achieve sustainable growth. To address these weaknesses in Greece and similar countries around the world, the authors present a comprehensive overview of the principles of innovation and entrepreneurship, with particular respect to their relationships to knowledge, learning, and creativity. Drawing from a strong theoretical foundation, and illustrated through in-depth case studies and examples from both private and public sectors, the authors present a framework for innovation management that integrates research, education, practical application, and policy. Specific topics include technology transfer, intellectual property rights management, the practice of knowledge management intellectual capital investment, business incubators, and Cooperation Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs).",3319112422,9783319112428,232,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KQwfBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=KQwfBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=73&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KQwfBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Entrepreneurship in China,Dr Keming Yang,"Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.",2012-12-28,"The emergence of China as a major world economy is of great importance to the global political economy and to international business. There has been much research on the macro level of institutional reform but little detailed work on the grassroots level of entrepreneurship in China. This innovative book addresses this gap by investigating how an economic system dominated by central plans, communist ideologies and suppressing bureaucracies could generate such energy from the bottom of society, fuelling the country's economic growth. Keming Yang’s theory of entrepreneurship is based on two interrelated concepts: double entrepreneurship and institutional holes. He argues that the two concepts bridge a gap between the neo-classical institutionalism of economic development and entrepreneurship studies that emphasize individual choice. The rigorous theoretical framework is supported by substantial empirical research, offering statistical analyses of survey data as well as detailed case studies.

David Rylander, Papers in Regional Science This book positions itself with an international approach and with a focus on entrepreneurship. My perception is that this will be read with major interest by policymakers around the world, who right now consider how to form strategies and construct policies to support their own creative industries. . . The book raises interesting aspects of creative industries in comparison to more traditional industries. . . Charlotta Mellander, International Small Business Journal This collection of papers adds some new dimensions to the current creative entrepreneurship research agenda. It highlights the valuable economic and social contribution of the sector but also encourages policymakers, educators and trainers to continue to evaluate the critical role they play in the creative enterprise development process. Culturelink . . . a delight to read. The book is novel and covers an important area of entrepreneurship that is definitely worthy of more attention.

Greene, Babson College, US The creative industries represent a vital, exciting and rapidly changing field of activity; one that is now recognised as a key growth sector in the knowledge-based economy. However, there is still a general lack of understanding of what is meant by the term creative industry , and thxe creative sector has not, to date, been the subject of concerted academic research. This book redresses the balance by providing valuable insights into the creative entrepreneurial process and platforming some of the key challenges yet to be addressed. A range of pertinent and diverse topics relating to creative entrepreneurship are dealt with, including the different quantitative and qualitative methodologies adopted by researchers in this field. In addition, the nature of creative entrepreneurship across different industry sub-sectors and in different economic and geographical contexts is examined. Illustrating the valuable economic and social contribution of the creative industries sector, Entrepreneurship in the Creative Industries aims to encourage policymakers, educators and trainers to continue to evaluate their critical role in the creative enterprise development process.

Entrepreneurship as Experience,"Michael H. Morris, Christopher G. Pryor, Minet Schindehutte",Edward Elgar Publishing,2012,"Do entrepreneurs create ventures or do venture experiences create entrepreneurs? The authors of Entrepreneurship as Experience propose that the answer is 'both'. This important volume examines how individuals experience the creation of a venture as it happens and how that experience determines the types of entrepreneur and venture that ultimately emerge. In essence, entrepreneurship is an experience consisting of large numbers of key events such as a first sale, hiring a first employee, losing a big account events that are processed and made sense of by the entrepreneur. They produce cognitive, emotional and physiological responses, which impact decision-making and behavior. The result is an experience that is purposive, diverse, uncertain, ambiguous and transformative and unique to each individual. Here, the authors argue that as experience unfolds both entrepreneur and venture are being constructed and emerge in unique forms. This experiential view introduces an entirely new lens through which entrepreneurship can be examined. Entrepreneurship as Experience comprises chapters dedicated to sociological, anthropological and psychological research related to human experiencing; the volume presents a new frame for understanding the role of emotions and feelings in venture creation and lays out a conceptual framework for understanding how real-time experiencing informs the entrepreneurial process. New insights are provided regarding how the entrepreneurial mindset and an entrepreneurial identity are formed, and why entrepreneurs take on certain traits and develop certain competencies. Further, the authors put forth new approaches to conducting research on the entrepreneurial experience.

Women, Technology and Entrepreneurship takes the reader through the trials, tribulations, and successes of women entrepreneurs in diverse sectors which have leveraged technology to achieve their goals.

Entrepreneurship and the City,Edward L. Glaeser,N/A,2007,"Why do levels of entrepreneurship differ across America's cities? This paper presents basic facts on two measures of entrepreneurship: the self-employment rate and the number of small firms. Both of these measures are correlated with urban success, suggesting that more entrepreneurial cities are more successful. There is considerable variation in the self-employment rate across metropolitan areas, but about one-half of this heterogeneity can be explained by demographic and industrial variation. Self-employment is particularly associated with abundant, older citizens and with the presence of input suppliers. Conversely, small firm size and employment growth due to unaffiliated new establishments is associated most strongly with the presence of input suppliers and an appropriate labor force. I also find support for the Chinitz (1961) hypothesis that entrepreneurship is linked to a large number of small firms in supplying industries. Finally, there is a strong connection between area-level education and entrepreneurship.",N/A,N/A,60,Cities and towns,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uxPwAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=uxPwAAAAMAAJ&q=Entrepreneurship&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=122&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=uxPwAAAAMAAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&source=gbs_api

"Entrepreneurship, Private and Public","Ruth C. Young, Joe D. Francis, Christopher H. Young",N/A,1999,"Entrepreneurship, Private and Public is a unique study that explores the regional structure of small manufacturers, the nature of their operations, and their relationship to larger industry and public agencies. It examines the role of entrepreneurship in modern society through a survey of small businesses and the economic development agencies that help them in upstate New York. Previous research on this topic has not addressed the impact of the public agencies that are run by and for entrepreneurs on small manufacturers. The results of this study challenge existing theories on small businesses, finding that they engage in a complex web of economic relationships with larger industry. Rather than being replaced, small manufacturers often fill specialized niches that serve larger industry. In this sense, small businesses are essential to understanding larger economic structures.

India's Century: The Age of Entrepreneurship in the World's Biggest Democracy,Kamal Nath,McGraw Hill Professional,2008,"In a short time, India has proven itself a major economic power, generating billions for its citizens and for the international community. How did India become a global market mover? And just as important, how can the Western world tap into the vast resources of commerce that India has, mine its phenomenal growth potential in a wide array of industries, and create a profitable relationship with the world’s largest democracy? Few authors are as qualified to answer those questions as Kamal Nath. Known at home and throughout the world as the face of twenty-first century India, as well as a major architect of India’s reform, Mr. Nath has spent his entire professional life within the corridors of power, helping to shape the policies that have catapulted his nation to world prominence. In India’s Century, Mr. Nath goes beyond the “flatworld” view to reveal the roots of the Indian economic miracle. With a compelling blend of economic analysis, political insight, and cultural observation, he traces his nation’s emergence from colonial rule in 1947 through four decades of planned economies, the gradual liberalization of India’s economy in the 1990s, and finally, the rise of the Indian global giant. Nath also explores his people’s unique can-do attitude (also known as jugaad) and the ages-old entrepreneurial spirit that is once again free to express itself at every level of Indian society. Along the way Minister Nath provides understanding for businesspeople and world policy makers attemptattempting to formulate strategies for forging a mutually beneficial engagement with India in the twentyfirst century. India’s Century is must reading for business strategists, public policy makers, and every thoughtful reader who wishes to understand more about the world’s largest, most vibrant democracy and the role it is likely to play on the global stage in the years ahead.",0071497293,9780071497299,242,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DlgMLlOawxIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,5,2,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=DlgMLlOawxIC&q=Entrepreneurship&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=150&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=DlgMLlOawxIC&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&source=gbs_api

The Good Entrepreneur,Cristina Santini,Springer Nature,2020-12-20,"This book explores the relationship between entrepreneurship and doing good. As research into entrepreneurship has evolved, so has the business environment and the society in which entrepreneurs work. Now more than ever, entrepreneurs are found to reflect on personal commitment, ethical issues and more recently, the influence they could have on society. In short they have embraced the concept of ‘the good entrepreneur.’ Over time many different strands of ‘good’ entrepreneurship have emerged; from social, green and sustainable entrepreneurship to ecopreneurship and so forth. Indeed some strands of research have merged while others have registered a lack of field research and analysis. In this book the author argues that this excessive fragmentation has created the need for a reflection on the role of niches in entrepreneurship. Providing analysis from multiple perspectives, the author provides an overview of the relationship between entrepreneurship and doing good as well as an exploration of the drivers that promote research in this field and an outline of research dynamics. Contributing to the current debate around the field of entrepreneurship and its ability to drive responsible and sustainable business practices, this book presents a comprehensive guide for students (graduate, master and PhD), academics and institutions and offers the reader an enhanced understanding of the evolution and research challenges within 'good entrepreneurship.'",3030593320,9783030593322,118,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NT4QEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=NT4QEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=152&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NT4QEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Entrepreneurship Education and Training Programs Around the World,"Alexandria Valerio, Brent Parton, Alicia Robb",World Bank Publications,2014-05-06,"Entrepreneurship has attracted global interest for its potential to catalyze economic and social development. Research suggesting that certain entrepreneurial mindsets and skills can be learned has given rise to the field of entrepreneurship education and training (EET). Despite the growth of EET, global knowledge about these programs and their impact remains thin. In response, this study surveys the available literature and program evaluations to propose a Conceptual Framework for understanding the EET program landscape. The study finds that EET today consists of a heterogeneous mix of programs that can be broken into two groups: entrepreneurship education and entrepreneurship training. These programs target a range of participants: secondary and post-secondary education students, as well as potential and practicing entrepreneurs. The outcomes measured by program evaluations are equally diverse but generally fall under the domains of entrepreneurial mindsets and capabilities, entrepreneurial status, and entrepreneurial performance. The dimensions of EET programs vary according the particular target group. Programs targeting secondary education students focus on the development of foundational skills linked to entrepreneurship, while post-secondary education programs emphasize skills related to strategic business planning. Programs targeting potential entrepreneurs generally are embedded within broader support programs and tend to target vulnerable populations for whom employment alternatives may be limited. While programs serving practicing entrepreneurs focus on strengthening entrepreneurs’ knowledge, skills and business practices, which while unlikely to transform an enterprise in the near term, may accrue benefits to entrepreneurs over time. The study also offers implications for policy and program implementation, emphasizing the importance of clarity about target groups and desired outcomes when making program choices, and sound understanding of extent to which publicly-supported programs offer a broader public good, and compare favorably to policy alternatives for supporting the targeted individuals as well as the overall economic and social objectives.",1464802025,9781464802027,287,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ypFtAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=ypFtAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=155&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=ypFtAwAAQBAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&source=gbs_api

The Business Idea,Soren Hougaard,Springer Science & Business Media,2006-03-20,"Successful business ideas are not so much about talent as about a systematic approach. The Business Idea encourages new ways of thinking when it comes to entrepreneurship and innovation. Too many ventures originate in the solutions the entrepreneur has to offer and not in the problem the customer needs solved. Business plans done this way can often lead to disappointment. The Business Idea leaves behind this product orientated logic. The book presents new, applicable entrepreneurship methods for developing creative market insight, for identifying windows of opportunity, creating business concepts and entrepreneurial strategies for successful market entry. Entrepreneurship is a complex and risky process compared to almost everything else in business life, so it richly deserves to have its own theoretical and methodological toolbox.

Entrepreneurship and the Market Process,"Arielle John, Diana W. Thomas",Palgrave Macmillan,2021-03-04,"What is the significance of entrepreneurship in an economy? Scholars have argued that when the market is viewed as a process of perpetual adjustment to various forces, and not as a set of end-state prices and quantities simply arrived at, the role of the entrepreneur comes to the fore. What then are fruitful ways to conceive of the phenomenon of entrepreneurship? How do entrepreneurs both respond to and shape larger forces in the economy? In what ways can political institutions and government regulation shape the decisions made by entrepreneurs, and their responsiveness to consumers? How does the cultural environment influence the types of opportunities that an entrepreneur will notice and act on? Finally, is entrepreneurial behavior strictly limited to activity we see in the market?

Women’s Entrepreneurship and Economics,"Miguel-Angel Galindo, Domingo Ribeiro",Springer Science & Business Media,2011-11-25,"Over the past century, an extensive literature has developed, exploring the impact of entrepreneurship on economic performance. The active participation of entrepreneurs in virtually all aspects of business and economic activity has obliged policy makers within the global economy to consider entrepreneurship as a determining variable in any political force, not only for bodies and groups created specifically to this end, but also for any decision-making body. To this end, specific actions promoting entrepreneurship have already been established around the world. However, the particular dynamics of entrepreneurship by women present unique opportunities and challenges. The women’s perspective has often been overlooked in research, practice, and policymaking, and yet yields rich insights and implications. This volume features research from an international array of authors, global data, and in-depth analysis of women’s entrepreneurial activity in Europe, Latin America, the United States, and Canada, to shed light on the positive impact of women’s entrepreneurship on economic growth and development. The first part covers a broad range of concepts relating to the history and context of the female economic perspective. The second part focuses on performance and success factors, with respect to such issues as innovation, social needs, and entrepreneurial orientation. The third part addresses issues of financing, including discussion of access to capital, microcredit, and entrepreneurial behavior. The fourth part considers additional topics, such as work-family balance and access to education. Together, the chapters offer new perspectives on the unique characteristics of women entrepreneurs and their contributions to economic development in theory, practice, and policymaking.",1461412935,9781461412939,229,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UFbpvR0ZSpQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=UFbpvR0ZSpQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=162&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=UFbpvR0ZSpQC&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&source=gbs_api

Entrepreneurship in Healthcare,"Ralf Wilden, Massimo Garbuio, Federica Angeli, Daniele Mascia",Routledge,2018-07-03,"Entrepreneurship in the Healthcare sector has received increased attention over the last two decades, both in terms of scholarly research and number of innovative enterprises. Entrepreneurial activities and innovations have emerged from and will continue to be driven by several actors along the healthcare value chain but especially from non-traditional healthcare players. In this new volume, we present the reader with several critical issues in healthcare entrepreneurship and innovation, covering a comprehensive set of research topics. We bring together the latest academic research and management practice, with contributions by authors from entrepreneurship, medical sciences, and management, who provide in depth and practical insights into designing and managing entrepreneurship in healthcare. Upon providing a systematic review of the research field, we discuss several important macro-, meso-, and micro-level issues in healthcare entrepreneurship, such as opportunity identification, the entrepreneurial ecosystem including accelerators, the benefits of open innovation for the sector, and social entrepreneurship in healthcare. These topics open up avenues for nurturing entrepreneurship in healthcare through both education and policy. Building on this trend, the book is organized around levels of analysis and specifies which cross-disciplinary efforts are needed to advance understanding of how entrepreneurs discover opportunities and start viable and innovative businesses.

Researching Entrepreneurship,Per Davidsson,Springer,2016-03-05,"In this book, one of the most highly recognized entrepreneurship scholars shares in a personal and readable way his rich experience and ideas on how entrepreneurship can be researched. Entrepreneurship is a phenomenon of tremendous societal importance. It is also an elusive phenomenon, which makes researching it fun, fascinating—and frustrating at times. In this fully updated edition, numerous real examples accompany the treatment of problems and solutions concerning design, sampling, operationalization and analysis. Researching Entrepreneurship is targeted primarily at research students and academics who are relatively new to research or to entrepreneurship research. This said, basic knowledge of research methods is assumed, and when foundational issues are discussed they are typically approach from a non-standard angle and/or with an eye to illuminate entrepreneurship-specific problems and solutions. This makes large parts of the contents potentially valuable for entrepreneurship scholars at any level of research proficiency. The book is also of interest to sophisticated, non-academic users with a professional interest in collecting and analyzing data from emerging and young ventures, and to those who make use of published entrepreneurship research. For example, analysts in marketing research or consultancy firms, business associations, statistical agencies and other government offices may find this book to be a valuable tool. Moreover, while the examples are derived from entrepreneurship research, the book provides a unique ""experienced empirical researcher"" (rather than ""textbook method expert"") treatment of issues that are of equal relevance across the social sciences. This goes for topics like the role of theory; research design; validity assessment; statistical inference, and replication. Entrepreneurship research has developed rapidly in the decade that has passed since the first edition. Therefore, all chapters have been comprehensively updated and many have been extended; sometimes to twice the original length. Two of the original chapters have been excluded to make room for entirely new chapters on “the Dependent Variable” and “The Entrepreneurship Nexus.” While retaining a unique, personal tone, the author uses examples and references that build on contributions from a large number of top entrepreneurship researchers.",3319266926,9783319266923,306,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5s6zCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=5s6zCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=171&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5s6zCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api
Organizing Entrepreneurship,"Anna Grandori, Laura Gaillard Giordani",Routledge,2011-05-09,"Entrepreneurship has regained centre stage in the contemporary knowledge-intensive and innovation-driven economy, as well as in research. Integrating classic and recent insights into the organization, economics and management of entrepreneurial activities, Organizing Entrepreneurship aims to blend rigor with relevance, and connects theory with practical problems around key questions, such as: Is there any method in having ‘good ideas’ and discovering opportunities? Through which mechanisms can human, social, technical and financial resources be attracted and dedicated to new projects? Which alternative governance and organizational structures are to be considered for the constitution and organization of a new firm? To grow or not to grow? (Or how to grow without up-sizing)? How do you organize grown-up firms in an entrepreneurial mode? How can environments and external institutions help? Original case studies are discussed and integrated throughout the text, which reflect a wide range of sectors (from agri-business to high tech) and countries (including emerging economies).

The Entrepreneurship Research Challenge,Per Davidsson,Edward Elgar Publishing,2009-01-01,". . . this is a single-authored book; a series of academic papers (some original, some fairly recently published), neatly set around a unifying theme and tied into a comprehensive argument. . . once you have shared Davidsson s insights, stumblings, joys, and humor over some 240 pages, it feels as if he were part of your family. The book sets off with a very clear and helpful introduction that lays out the entrepreneurship phenomenon . . . This book is value adding for a fairly wide academic audience: essentially all those interested in diverse areas of entrepreneurship and innovation, or in questions of methodology, research design and interpretation of, ultimately, any complex, fast paced behavioural and social realities. It does not give us all the answers, thank heavens, but it certainly asks some excellent questions. . . the novice scholar, will find some welcome foothold and guidance. . . this book is simply fun to read; when could you last say that of a research methodology book? Jacqueline Fendt, International Journal of Entrepreneurial Behaviour and Research Unquestionably, Per Davidsson can be considered a leading voice of authority on the study of entrepreneurship as an academic discipline. . . From the initial introduction through to the latter discussions, one aspect of this textbook that immediately makes itself apparent to the reader is Davidsson s markedly personal and deeply engaging writing style. The Entrepreneurship Research Challenge is notably distinct from many of the generic business research methods texts in that it does not attempt to portray an objective toolbox of methodological choices. Instead, the style is such that the reader feels that Davidsson truly wishes for his audience to learn from his unique experiences, opinions and even mistakes. . . the practical advice provided is both insightful and useful. . . this text is not simply about how to go through the motions of the research process. Instead, it makes a very well reasoned attempt to form a basis for the discipline as a whole as well as to address methods to overcome unique challenges while promoting research output that is useful. For these reasons it should be considered essential reading for any entrepreneurship scholar, and in particular, for those at the early stages of their research career. Russell Matthews, International Small Business Journal Entrepreneurship is an emerging, dynamic and to a considerable extent, unpredictable phenomenon. Thus, it makes for a challenging research subject. In this book, one of the most experienced empiricists in the field has collected some of his most important ideas on how improved conceptualization and research design can make this challenge more manageable. Per Davidsson addresses questions such as: What precisely is entrepreneurship and entrepreneurship research? What unique contribution can it make compared with research in other fields? Conversely, how can scholars with different disciplinary backgrounds best contribute to the study of entrepreneurship? What does the emergent and highly diverse nature of entrepreneurship imply for research design? And what is required from entrepreneurship researchers and practitioners in order for the research to make strong contributions to business and policy practice? This comprehensive, in-depth account of how the emergence of new entrepreneurial activity can be studied will be warmly welcomed by researchers and academics in the areas of entrepreneurship, innovation and methodology and research design.",1848442769,9781848442764,255,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WcwMLPJyn7wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=WcwMLPJyn7wC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=177&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WcwMLPJyn7wC&source=gbs_api

Overseas Chinese Entrepreneurship and Capitalist Development in Southeast Asia,Annabelle R. Gambe,LIT Verlag Münster,2000,"The study aims at finding an explanation to the economic development of Southeast Asia. To achieve this end, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines have been chosen as the foci of the study. To explain the region's recent success, the study is guided by the hypothesis that overseas Chinese entrepreneurship, exercised by a group belonging to a discriminated ethnic minority, is an indispensable component of the capitalist development of Southeast Asia. Overseas Chinese businesses dominate nearly all branches of the economy of their respective countries of residence. On a regional scale, they are acknowledged to control two-thirds of the region's retail trade. The hypothesis of the study is validated by the empirical findings. Furthermore, the study has arrived at the conclusion that Southeast Asia is host to a type of entrepreneurship - Overseas Chinese entrepreneurship - that evolved and developed throughout the centuries and proven for its resiliency and risk-taking abilities. It did not create the boom in the region, however. Liberal government policies, the inflow of huge foreign capital, and the availability of cheap and skilled labor among the indigenous population are among the more crucial factors that facilitated this transformation.",3825843866,9783825843861,196,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZUfNRG8IR44C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=ZUfNRG8IR44C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=180&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZUfNRG8IR44C&source=gbs_api

The “emerging” nature of the studied countries provides specific insights, and allows the theoretical developments to be fine-tuned to the current issues. In a context that makes competitive advantages transient, emerging markets can provide a real test case for responding in a structural and innovative way to social and economic challenges, thus ensuring the sustainable performance of their innovative entrepreneurial system.

Contextualizing Entrepreneurship Theory,"Ted Baker, Friederike Welter",Routledge,2020-02-13,"As the breadth and empirical diversity of entrepreneurship research have increased rapidly during the last decade, the quest to find a ""one-size-fits-all"" general theory of entrepreneurship has given way to a growing appreciation for the importance of contexts. This promises to improve both the practical relevance and the theoretical rigor of research in this field. Entrepreneurship means different things to different people at different times and in different places and both its causes and its consequences likewise vary. For example, for some people entrepreneurship can be a glorious path to emancipation, while for others it can represent the yoke tethering them to the burdens of overwork and drudgery. For some communities it can drive renaissance and vibrancy while for others it allows only bare survival. In this book, we assess and attempt to push forward contemporary conceptualizations of contexts that matter for entrepreneurship, pointing in particular to opportunities generating new insights by attending to contexts in novel or underexplored ways. This book shows that the ongoing contextualization of entrepreneurship research should not simply generate a proliferation of unique theories – one for every context – but can instead result in better theory construction, testing and understanding of boundary conditions, thereby leading us to richer and more profound understanding of entrepreneurship across its many forms. Contextualizing Entrepreneurship Theory will critically review the current debate and existing literature on contexts and entrepreneurship and use this to synthesize new theoretical and methodological frameworks that point to important directions for future research.",1351110616,9781351110617,172,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xfzRDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=xfzRDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=187&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xfzRDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Empirical Analysis of Entrepreneurship and Economic Growth,André van Stel,Springer,2010-11-23,"The importance of entrepreneurship for achieving economic growth in contemporary economies is widely recognized, both by policy makers and economists. It is deeply embedded in the current European policy approach that the creativity and independence of entrepreneurs contribute to higher levels of economic activity. Indeed, according to the European Commission (2003, p. 9), ""The challenge for the European Union is to identify the key factors for building a climate in which entrepreneurial initiative and business activities can thrive. Policy measures should seek to boost the Union's levels of entrepreneurship, adopting the most appropriate approach for producing more entrepreneurs and for getting more firms to grow. "" Audretsch (2003, p. 5) states that ""Entrepreneurship has become the engine of economic and social development throughout the world. "" The relation between entrepreneurship and economic growth is embedded in several strands of the economic literature. A first strand of literature involves the general understanding of the role of entrepreneurship in the modern economy. Seminal contributions were made by Schumpeter (1934), Knight (1921) and Kirzner (1973). These economists stress different aspects of the role of the entrepreneur. While Schumpeter stresses the innovating aspect, Knight stresses the risk assuming aspect. Kirzner, finally, stresses the role of the entrepreneur in leading markets to equilibrium.

Fostering Local Entrepreneurship in a Multinational Enterprise,"Joe J. Amberg, Sara L.

Yet it remains elusive for many firms. In a collaboration between a practitioner and academic, Joe J. Amberg and Sara L. McGaughey explore corporate entrepreneuring within a large conglomerate multinational enterprise: Siemens AG. In early 2009, following a prolonged period of business stagnation and a huge bribery scandal, Siemens’ top management identified a severe lack of entrepreneurship as a critical issue. The strengthening of ‘local entrepreneurship’ became a new priority in the strategic planning for 2010 to 2014. By examining three contrasting ventures in the Siemens business unit Fire Safety between 2008 and 2012, the authors identify key drivers and impediments that sustain inertia in corporate entrepreneuring within this global organisation.

Paul Westhead, International Small Business Journal This is a formidable and weighty tome. . . More important than sheer quantity is consideration of the quality, and here the broad spread yet eclectic choice of the research papers is most enlightening. The contributing authors have collectively condensed much of the knowledge garnered from the past five years of this global field into one handy sourcebook. . . The end result is, indeed, a fresh recognition, if recognition still needs to be made, of the major importance of this new global growth phenomenon of international entrepreneurship. Mark Haydon, International Journal of Entrepreneurship and Innovation The Handbook is a nearly comprehensive reference work to the field that will be useful to scholars new to the area as well as those already engaged in it. . . I was impressed by the diversity of the authors. . . The Handbook is an excellent broad reference to the field. Ben Oviatt, Journal of International Business Studies Over the last few years there has been an increased interest in research on the internationalization of new ventures and the global challenges facing growing young businesses. The Handbook of Research on International Entrepreneurship has collected and synthesized the contributions of leading researchers in an effort to define and categorize the unique contributions and state-of-the-art of this emerging field. It provides a comprehensive, multi-disciplinary treatment that advances the frontiers of knowledge regarding the fundamental concepts, methods, and theories of international entrepreneurship. The Handbook should serve as both an authoritative and comprehensive reference work for researchers, and a state-of-the-art compilation of new insights for educational leaders. Ari Ginsberg, New York University Stern School of Business, US Entrepreneurship and international business have remained separate subjects for far too long. The study of international entrepreneurship thrives on the cross-fertilisation of ideas between these fields. It is one of the most dynamic research areas in economics and management. The contributors to this Handbook are the pioneers in the field, and this volume provides a definitive survey of their work. Mark Casson, University of Reading, UK These notable researchers share a common dedication to rigorous methodologies and vigorous research. Together in this volume, the researchers have assembled and presented a cross-section of tested methods, and innovative approaches. These contributions are an inspiration to younger researchers, and this bids fair to set the tone, and level of intellectual rigour and vigour for future research in the emerging field of international entrepreneurship. From the preface by Bob Kirk, University of Canterbury, New Zealand This unique reference book provides an array of diverse perspectives on international entrepreneurship, a new and emerging field of research that blends concepts and methodologies from more traditional social sciences. The Handbook includes chapters written by top researchers of economics and sociology, as well as academic leaders in the fields of entrepreneurship and international business. State-of-the-art contributions provide up-to-date literature reviews, making this book essential for the researcher of entrepreneurship and the internationalisation of entrepreneurs.",1845420519,9781845420512,855,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JgOdwOftd_YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=JgOdwOftd_YC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=202&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JgOdwOftd_YC&source=gbs_api

The Truth about Entrepreneurship,Paul D. Reynolds,Edward Elgar Publishing,2020-11-27,"Policy makers give a lot of attention to business creation and entrepreneurship, but they do not have a good resource for understanding The Truth about Entrepreneurship. The extensive media coverage of Wall Street entrepreneurship provides an incomplete portrayal of most business creation. While both high profile and everyday new firms provide major contributions to economic growth, the ongoing, bottoms-up activity pursued by over half a billion around the world is not widely recognized. This book reviews some of the most salient features of grass roots business creation, such as the total amount of activity, differences related to national economic development, the relationship to business churning and job creation, the impact of national context, the mixed contributions of high growth firms, the modest effect of external financial support, the unequal distribution of sunk costs related to successful payback, importance as an option for the most desperate in poor countries, and the tendency to overlook the continuing incremental impact of Main Street business creation.Entrepreneurial scholars, faculty, policy analysists and graduate students interested in economic development, entrepreneurship and public policy will find clarity and gain a depth of knowledge about policy making and business creation with The Truth about Entrepreneurship.",1788978331,9781788978330,224,N/A,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XPeQzQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=XPeQzQEACAAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=204&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=XPeQzQEACAAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&source=gbs_api
Against Entrepreneurship,Anders Örtenblad,Springer Nature,2020-10-28,"This book explores whether there is reason to be against entrepreneurship. Just like literature on the darker sides of entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship, the book is an answer to the one-sided, overly positive and uncritical image of entrepreneurship. The “twist” in this book, in comparison with literature on dark sides of entrepreneurship, is to explore being against entrepreneurship. From various perspectives such as lexical semantics, Marxism, philosophy of science and psychology, the contributors contemplate on why there may be reason to be against entrepreneurship discourse as well as entrepreneurship practice. Some chapters are based on first-hand empirical data, others are conceptual. The main overall conclusion is that there are some strong arguments for being against entrepreneurship discourse, as well as for being against certain aspects of entrepreneurship practice. Before it is reasonable to be against entrepreneurship practice in total, a convincing and practicable alternative needs to be developed. This book will be valuable reading for entrepreneurship scholars, as well as academics working in the fields of business ethics, (critical) management, and international business.",3030479374,9783030479374,297,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kvoFEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=kvoFEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=205&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kvoFEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Entrepreneurship As Social Change,"Chris Steyaert, Daniel Hjorth",Edward Elgar Publishing,2008-01-01,". . . a reflective and scholarly work that presents exciting and challenging views to mainstream entrepreneurship. . . The four books comprising the series would certainly be a valuable addition to any entrepreneurship library. However, each book also stands alone as an individual purchase. Lorraine Warren, International Journal of Entrepreneurial Behaviour and Research The narrative and flow of the book is superb and very interesting to read. The book is well edited and thought provoking which makes it an interesting read. Vanessa Ratten, Journal of Enterprising Communities: People and Places in the Global Economy This book the third in the Movements in Entrepreneurship series examines entrepreneurship as a societal phenomenon. It provides an in-depth study of the social aspects of entrepreneurship, illustrating how entrepreneurship affects society. The need to move beyond economy to disclose entrepreneurship in its societal forms is demonstrated, as is the relevance of our understanding of entrepreneurship as a societal phenomenon. The contributors show that entrepreneurship is a society-creating force and as such, it evokes new questions for entrepreneurship research and attempts to engage with new theoretical formulations. They begin with discussions on early Schumpeter and a rhetorical analysis of the current academic literature on social entrepreneurship. They go on to present myriad contextual examples of how entrepreneurship can shape social change, and indicate how this is initiated through various social settings, relationships and communities. Through rich empirical work this book explores the social of social entrepreneurship and in doing so shows us how entrepreneurship is at home where society is created. As such, it will prove a fascinating read for academics, researchers and students with an interest in entrepreneurship, sociology and economic sociology.",1847204422,9781847204424,341,Social Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4uYrqTwMZB4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=4uYrqTwMZB4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=207&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4uYrqTwMZB4C&source=gbs_api
Youth Entrepreneurship and Local Development in Central and Eastern Europe,"Paul Blokker, Bruno Dallago","Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.",2008,"This work analyses the opportunities and barriers for youth entrepreneurship amid systemic change in Central and Eastern Europe. The authors cover different aspects of youth entrepreneurship and its contribution to the debate on youth unemployment in transition economies. The book discusses the wide-spread over-optimism regarding youth entrepreneurship, self-employment, and its impact on economic innovation and job creation, resulting from a disregard of critical contextual features and the characteristics of young entrepreneurs themselves. The authors give due acknowledgment of the importance of both factors and so fully understand the impediments to youth entrepreneurship, especially in a transition context.

Handbook of Research on Entrepreneurship Policy,"David B. Audretsch, Isabel Grilo, A. Roy Thurik",Edward Elgar Publishing,2007,"This book is a well written and handy source for readers. Additionally, it provides an overview of current issues relevant to the development of entrepreneurial policy, which is based on interesting case studies across a number of nations. . . Dessy Irawati, International Journal of Entrepreneurial Behaviour and Research What is new in the world is the need to understand business dynamics; the entry, exit and growth of firms in the economy. This dynamic firm structure, as opposed to the static firm structure that dominated past thinking, has spurred an outpouring of research. The heart of the issue is that while many have identified the importance of business dynamics (entry and exit) we have only recently taken a closer look at the ecological system in which some companies must die for others to thrive. Entrepreneurs are the predators of this system. Public policy in an entrepreneurial economy (dynamic) must limit the forces that prevent firm exit and foster the forces that promote firm entry. This book makes an important contribution to the debate. Zoltan J. Acs, George Mason University, US and Max Planck Institute of Economics, Germany This unique Handbook provides a solid foundation for essential study in the nascent field of entrepreneurship policy research. This foundation is initially developed via the exploration of two significant propositions underpinning the nature of entrepreneurship policy research. The first is that entrepreneurship has emerged as a bona fide focus of public policy, particularly with respect to economic growth and employment creation. The second is that neither scholars nor policy makers are presently equipped to understand the public policy role for entrepreneurship. The contributors experienced scholars, specialist researchers and dynamic policy makers thus grapple with novel questions of considerable policy relevance that few have previously posed. The Handbook therefore provides some of the first crucial, systematic analyses of important issues, and key questions to be raised in order to move entrepreneurship policy forward are also presented. Written by academics and practitioners drawing examples from both North America and Europe, this stimulating new Handbook is a prerequisite for students, scholars and practitioners in the incipient world of entrepreneurship policy.",1847206794,9781847206794,251,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nyAjjdsMHFgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=nyAjjdsMHFgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=210&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nyAjjdsMHFgC&source=gbs_api

They argue that this more complete picture of entrepreneurial phenomena will likely come from scholars who undertake at least some trailblazing projects; from scholars who broaden the range of research questions, the potential outcomes of entrepreneurial action, and the selection and combination of research methods; and from researchers who avoid the endless debates about the margins of the field and its sub-fields or about whether one theoretical or philosophical lens is superior to another. This book offers suggestions for future research through a variety of topics including prosocial action, innovation, family business, sustainability and development, and the financial, social, and psychological costs of failure.

Entrepreneurship Policy: Theory and Practice,"Anders Lundstrom, Lois A.

From a study and assessment of the practices of governments in thirteen countries in Europe, North America and the Asia-Pacific region, this book fully describes the policy area and shares new tools and methods for better understanding and explaining the how and why of an entrepreneurship policy approach. The work features a number of new methods which can be used to analyze and assess policy gaps and opportunities for future actions in the area and for understanding the most appropriate mix of policy options. Methods of note include the entrepreneurship policy comprehensiveness index and the context method. It presents a conceptual model describing the many factors which affect, in a dynamic way, the level of entrepreneurship in a country or region. It also describes a typology of entrepreneurship policy which will be useful to others in categorizing their policy approaches. Unlike other research in the field of entrepreneurship where implications from research findings are used to suggest what policy actions should be taken to increase the level of entrepreneurship in an economy, this study is based on what entrepreneurship policy actions are being taken.

"Business, Entrepreneurship and Innovation Toward Poverty Reduction","Steven Si, David Ahlstrom, Wei Jiang, John Cullen",Routledge,2021-07-26,"Ways in which poverty can be reduced in both countries and regions through business, entrepreneurship and government has been a hot issue for researchers and policymakers in recent years. Governments can play an important role in helping the poor people by non-profit organizations and others that help to seed business among the poor. Businesses increasingly also see the large number of people in severe poverty not only as an issue for social concern, but also as a potentially large untapped market of consumers for goods and services. Some scholars have called for poverty reduction through entrepreneurship owing to the fact that it can be an efficient path to also change the poor's attitudes and behaviours from a passive mode, to a more active mode towards poverty reduction economically and socially. In addition, the sharing economy brings opportunities where everyone is a micro-entrepreneur. There is a recognition that these types of entrepreneurship above could offer the greatest single potential means to move individuals out of poverty in the nations and regions in the next 5-10 years. This book provides new and valuable analyses of poverty and business, entrepreneurship and innovation in current nations and regions including developing and developed countries. As business, entrepreneurship and innovation can help to generate greater business activity in settings of severe poverty, they will help to solve poverty, as individuals in severe poverty are able to both generate greater incomes and accumulate greater assets as they participate with large firms in those activities.

Agarwal, Olav Sorenson",Springer Science & Business Media,2006-03-30,"early economic thinkers and classic works such as Cantillon (1755), Knight (1921), and Kirzner (1973). The paper opens by explaining how uncertainty and thus entrepreneurship disappeared from microeconomic theory as it became increasingly formalized (and stylized). It then goes on to bring the entrepreneur and entrepreneurial decision-making back into economic theory by focusing on the interrelationships among actors, knowledge, and perceived economic opportunities using a resource-based framework. The third paper in this section (Chapter 4) is by Foss and Klein, ""Entrepreneurship and the Economic Theory of the Firm: Any Gains from Trade?"" Foss and Klein strongly link theories of the firm to entrepreneurship, arguing a fundamental and intrinsic connection between the two. They, like Mahoney and Michael, explain how entrepreneurship became less important in economic models as the general equilibrium model became dominant. Foss and Klein ask: Does the entrepreneur need a firm? They focus on the judgment of the entrepreneur and suggest that this judgment is exercised through asset ownership and starting a firm. Foss and Klein further argue that it is through this notion of judgment that heterogeneous assets combine to meet future wants.",0387236228,9780387236223,286,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=u-XROUp6g1MC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=u-XROUp6g1MC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=222&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=u-XROUp6g1MC&source=gbs_api
Entrepreneurship,Alan S. Gutterman,Business Expert Press,2018-08-30,"This book provides an introduction to a number of important topics relevant to the study and understanding of entrepreneurship and the process of creating, or giving birth to, a new business. Entrepreneurship has become a popular career path in developed and developing countries, a phenomenon that has contributed to the intense interest in the subject shown by researchers and policymakers around the world. Several factors have come into play, including advances in technology that allowed smaller firms to take advantage of economies of scale that previously were only available to larger firms; the ability of smaller firms, because of their size, to be more flexible and responsive to market changes; implementation of government policies calculated to encourage entrepreneurial activities and behavior; support from governments and other economic units that established procurement programs to assist small businesses; high unemployment rates in recent decades due to corporate restructuring and downsizing, which have caused some workers to choose an entrepreneurial path rather than retrain for placement in an unsteady job market as a means for dealing with their midlife crisis; and changes in typical career patterns away from expectations of long-term employment with large firms in a single occupation toward a flexible labor force, a phenomenon that has led to increased interest in entrepreneurship among those with post-secondary education and an established career record build over several decades in the workplace. The chapters cover definitions and types of entrepreneurship; the relationships among entrepreneurship, innovation and development; research on entrepreneurship, comparative research into entrepreneurship in multiple countries and research into cross- border entrepreneurship (i.e., international activity of small- and medium-sized enterprises and new ventures); factors influencing entrepreneurial activities; motivational traits of prospective entrepreneurs; the influence of societal culture on entrepreneurial activities and attitudes regarding entrepreneurship as a career path; the influence that the institutional environment has on entrepreneurship; and the role of entrepreneurs in launching new businesses. This book is an excellent introductory source of information on entrepreneurship research for use by academics and other professionals in their courses and for entrepreneurs looking to fit their dreams and aspirations in the broader context of entrepreneurship.",1948976544,9781948976541,246,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5yFrDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=5yFrDwAAQBAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=223&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=5yFrDwAAQBAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&source=gbs_api
Innovative Entrepreneurship in Action,Giuseppina Passiante,Springer,2020-05-14,"This book analyses prevailing approaches and policies in innovative entrepreneurship. It explores the ways in which entrepreneurs learn and develop innovation-based businesses to drive increased regional competitiveness. Specifically, the contributions propose that sustainable innovation ecosystems booster innovative entrepreneurship and thus create a competitive advantage for smart and sustainable growth. It also examines the current state of entrepreneurship education, where the development of entrepreneurial abilities is considered a process of value creation—both economic and social—with the final aim to create both new start-ups and entrepreneurial mind-sets.Featuring theoretical approaches and empirical evidences, this title is appropriate for scholars, academics, students and policy makers in technology and innovation management, economics of innovation and entrepreneurship.",3030425371,9783030425371,207,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-SpNzQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=-SpNzQEACAAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=224&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=-SpNzQEACAAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&source=gbs_api
Entrepreneurship and Cluster Dynamics,"Cristina Boari, Tom Elfring, Xavier Molina-Morales",Routledge,2016-06-10,"Entrepreneurship and Cluster Dynamics focuses on the origin and development of clusters and specifically on the role played by the strategic entrepreneurship in these contexts. Although separately entrepreneurship and cluster studies have already attracted the attention of academics and practitioners; this book aims to go further and offer an integrated and interactive view of topics. The cross-cutting approach is one of the main attributes of this book. In fact, the book involves a great range of organizational and economic perspectives, from social psychology to conventional applied economics disciplines. Moreover, these topics allow the use of different levels of analysis, from the individual entrepreneur behind a start-up to the structure of cluster networks, including the organizational levels. An analysis of the change and development of clusters going further than traditional functional approaches by examining how entrepreneurs and their actions are not only influenced by the cluster but also shape the cluster development, will offer an explanation of how entrepreneurship and networking entrepreneurs can foster, perhaps also inhibit, cluster development and change. Finally Entrepreneurship and Cluster Dynamics theorizes about the role of the strategic entrepreneurship in developing start-ups inside already established companies, which can play the role of broker in the cluster. Entrepreneurship and Cluster Dynamics offers a unique opportunity to academics, researchers, and students to learn about relations and interactions between entrepreneurship and cluster perspectives, providing both newly and original theoretical propositions and also rigorous conclusive empirical exercises.",1317300017,9781317300014,248,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=z7lTDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=z7lTDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=225&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=z7lTDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Impossible Jobs in Public Management,"Erwin C. Hargrove, John C. Glidewell",Studies in Government and Public Policy,1990,"If you think your job is hopelessly difficult, you may be right. Particularly if your job is public administration. Those who study or practice public management know full well the difficulties faced by administrators of complex bureaucratic systems. What they don't know is why some jobs in the public sector are harder than others and how good managers cope with those jobs. Drawing on leadership theory and social psychology, Erwin Hargrove and John Glidewell provide the first systematic analysis of the factors that determine the inherent difficulty of public management jobs and of the coping strategies employed by successful managers. To test their argument, Hargrove and Glidewell focus on those jobs fraught with extreme difficulties—""impossible"" jobs. What differentiates impossible from possible jobs are (1) the publicly perceived legitimacy of the commissioner's clientele; (2) the intensity of the conflict among the agency's constituencies; (3) the public's confidence in the authority of the commissioner's profession; and (4) the strength of the agency's ""myth,"" or long-term, idealistic goal. Hargrove and Glidewell flesh out their analysis with six case studies that focus on the roles played by leaders of specific agencies. Each essay summarizes the institutional strengths and weaknesses, specifies what makes the job impossible, and then compares the skills and strategies that incumbents have employed in coping with such jobs. Readers will come away with a thorough understanding of the conflicting social, psychological, and political forces that act on commissioners in impossible jobs.",N/A,N/A,228,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Vb2GAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=Vb2GAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA23&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=232&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=Vb2GAAAAMAAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&source=gbs_api

Islamic Entrepreneurship,"Rasem N. Kayed, M. Kabir Hassan",Routledge,2013-12-16,"This book discusses the idea that there is a specific Islamic form of entrepreneurship. Based on extensive original research amongst small and medium sized enterprises in Saudi Arabia, it shows how businesses are started and how they grow in the context of an Islamic economy and society. It argues that as specific Islamic approaches to a wide range of economic activities are being formulated and implemented, there is indeed a particular Islamic approach to entrepreneurship. Examining the relationship between Islamic values and entrepreneurial activity, the book considers whether such values can be more effectively used in order to raise the profile of Islamic entrepreneurship, and also to promote alternatives to development in the contemporary business environment.

Entrepreneurial Universities,"Marta Peris-Ortiz, Jaime Alonso Gómez, José M. Merigó-Lindahl, Carlos Rueda-Armengot",Springer,2016-12-13,"This book analyses the importance of the entrepreneurial university, specifically in relation to the creation of entrepreneurial ideas and attitudes in students and entrepreneurial initiatives in academic institutions. The aim of the editors and contributing authors is to provide the reader with a set of experiences illustrating the advantages of communicating and encouraging entrepreneurship among students, thereby highlighting the “third mission” of the university: the need to adopt entrepreneurial strategy without disrupting the quality of teaching and research. Featuring initiatives from institutions around the world, the authors argue that the increasing importance of knowledge in the technical and social dimensions of today’s world provides greater relevance to the entrepreneurial university. In this context, universities transcend their traditional focus on teaching and basic research to carry out technology transfers, marketing ideas, and patent registrations, and incorporate spin-off companies that contribute to industrial innovations, economic growth, and job creation. In the teaching dimension, the entrepreneurial university represents a focus on programs which train students in the applications and most advanced practices in knowledge-driven fields. The book addresses such questions as: Can marketing ideas deteriorate the quality of research in the long term? What importance does the cultural framework have for an entrepreneurial education? What circumstances and programs facilitate spin-offs in universities What are the key features of entrepreneurial universities? In reference to entrepreneurship education in its broadest sense, then, it corresponds to the framework of ideas and general features on which entrepreneurship is founded: in-depth knowledge of the projects or ventures which they wish to carry out, capacity to perceive the relevant characteristics of the environment, and the leadership and goal setting skills to achieve success.",3319479490,9783319479491,316,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2dO4DQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=2dO4DQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=235&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2dO4DQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Handbook of Research on Corporate Entrepreneurship,"Shaker A. Zahra, Donald O. Neubaum, James C. Hayton",N/A,2018-07-27,"Corporate entrepreneurship is about remaking organizations; it affects organizational cultures and systems which, in turn, influence the magnitude, direction and content of corporate entrepreneurship activities. This Handbook hopes to synthesize what we know and clarify what we need to know about key issues such as strategic renewal, innovation and venturing activities within established companies, giving direction to future research. This Handbook combines conceptual and empirical contributions covering a wide gamut of theories and perspectives that include: opportunity discovery vs. creation, the behavioral theory of the firm, learning, human capital, agency, and dynamic capabilities. The chapters uncover who the corporate entrepreneur is, how corporate entrepreneurs vary from their independent counterparts, how corporate entrepreneurship influences organizational performance, and the effect of incremental versus radical strategic renewal undertaken within corporate entrepreneurship on financial performance. They also investigate what an organization learns from corporate entrepreneurship, as well as the types of innovation that companies gain through corporate venturing capital investments. The diversity of authors, perspectives and foci of the chapters highlight the growing depth and breadth of the worldwide research on corporate entrepreneurship and the growing maturity of this research. This book will appeal to scholars and students of entrepreneurship and/or strategic management, as well as managers of established firms. Contributors: S. Basu, H. Burgers, J.J. Chrisman, D. Day, G.

Enterprising Africa,"Stephen Dobson, Paul Jones, Daniel Agyapong, Gideon Maas",Routledge,2020-12-30,"Enterprising Africa explores the future opportunities, challenges, growth areas and key themes that will shape entrepreneurship in the African continent over the next decade. Entrepreneurship can be the key to unlock resilient growth, but only if it is driven by both socially productive and growth-oriented new businesses. The book considers entrepreneurship as an enabler for socio-economic growth and development in Africa, especially in the context of youth unemployment and increasing youth population for which the traditional, and indeed emerging, industrial sectors will not be able to produce sufficient jobs to meet demand. Organised around three thematic parts, Part I covers the notion of inclusive growth and the role that entrepreneurs can play supporting this.

Peace Through Entrepreneurship,"Steven R. Koltai, Matthew Muspratt",N/A,2016,""" Joblessness is the root cause of the global unrest threatening American security. Fostering entrepreneurship is the remedy. The combined weight of American diplomacy and military power cannot end unrest and extremism in the Middle East and other troubled regions of the world, Steven Koltai argues. Koltai says an alternative approach would work: investing in entrepreneurship and reaping the benefits of the jobs created through entrepreneurial startups. From 9/11 and the Arab Spring to the self-proclaimed Islamic caliphate, instability and terror breed where young people cannot find jobs. Koltai marshals evidence to show that joblessness--not religious or cultural conflict--is the root cause of the unrest that vexes American foreign policy and threatens international security. Drawing on Koltai's stint as senior adviser for Entrepreneurship in Secretary Hillary Clinton's State Department, and his thirty-year career as a successful entrepreneur and business executive, Peace through Entrepreneurship argues for the significant elevation of entrepreneurship in the service of foreign policy; not rural microfinance or mercantile trading but the scalable stuff of Silicon Valley and Sam Walton, generating the vast majority of new jobs in economies large and small. Peace through Entrepreneurship offers a nonmilitary, long-term solution at a time of disillusionment with Washington's ""big development"" approach to unstable and underdeveloped parts of the world--and when the new normal is fear of terrorist attacks against Western targets, beheadings in Syria, and jihad. Extremism will not be resolved by a war on terror. The answer, Koltai shows, is stimulating entrepreneurial economic opportunities for the virtually limitless supply of desperate, unemployed young men and women leading lives of endless economic frustration.""",0815729235,9780815729235,0,BUSINESS & ECONOMICS,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7NBfjwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=7NBfjwEACAAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=244&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=7NBfjwEACAAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&source=gbs_api

Only more recently, the important link between communities and entrepreneurs has emerged as a new frontier in entrepreneurship research. This book brings the emerging nexus between community and entrepreneur to light by exploring the mutual impact that communities and entrepreneurs have on one another.

Entrepreneurship,"Rudy Aernoudt, Marc Van Rompaey",N/A,2015,"Entrepreneurship is a mindset. However, studies show that entrepreneurship still remains a structural and cultural anomaly in continental Europe. Starting from this hypothesis, this book shows how Europe could be made entrepreneurship friendly. Entrepreneurship is discussed from start to growth, and the book pleads for an environment where an entrepreneurship culture can be developed whereby success is applauded and failure tolerated. This is the only way to create sustainable growth and employment. In relation to policy, the book shows that classical subsidy policy often has a perverse effect, keeping alive lame ducks and hindering real entrepreneurs in their growth. Subsidies kill the economy. Incubators and innovative financing tools - such as business angels, crowd-funding, and seed money - are discussed as a real alternative allowing entrepreneurs to undertake new projects. However, these instruments only make sense in an entrepreneurial environment. A radical shift towards entrepreneurship policy is therefore needed, guaranteeing a prosperous economy and much better value for public money. Entrepreneurship should be(come) a way of life.

Women and Entrepreneurship,"Dr Beatrice E Avolio Alecchi, Dr Mirjana Radovic-Markovic","Gower Publishing, Ltd.",2013-09-02,"Women and Entrepreneurship comes from two authors with especially rich experience in this field of research. Embracing experience in a range of developed and developing countries and examining both dependent and independent roles, Beatrice Avolio and Mirjana Radović-Marković profile women entrepreneurs and consider their motivations, together with the obstacles and challenges that they face and often overcome. A focus on emerging forms of entrepreneurship leads to a concentration on what is happening in newly developing economies, with a major case study set in a South American context. The authors deal in particular with how rural entrepreneurship, virtual entrepreneurship, and project-based and home-based businesses particularly lend themselves to providing opportunities for women. The authors’ findings reveal that increased participation of women in business leadership has brought about completely new ways of business communication; new business strategies and company development models; and is imposing a new behavioural style on businesses. What is particularly encouraging is the evidence that female kinds of durability, persistence and intuition are producing business advantage. This means that the authors can clearly identify success factors and propose guidelines for the benefit of female entrepreneurs, female-led businesses, and business in general. This book will serve the needs of an academic audience of researchers in the growing field of studies into entrepreneurship; as well as those teaching or studying business or women’s studies topics. It will of course appeal particularly to women owning and running businesses, or aspiring to do so.",1409466205,9781409466208,240,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=n8ujAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=n8ujAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=263&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=n8ujAgAAQBAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&source=gbs_api
The Anthropology of Entrepreneurship,Richard Pfeilstetter,Routledge,2021-11-24,"The Anthropology of Entrepreneurship provides a comprehensive overview of the unique contribution from anthropology to the field of entrepreneurship studies. Insights from anthropology illuminate the wider socio-cultural implications of entrepreneurialism, a moral order and social practice that is profoundly shaping contemporary society. Revisiting classic works in anthropology from a new angle, this book provides an exciting introduction to diverse conceptual framings of economic agency. The author also examines a wide range of 21st century ethnographies from the Global South, alongside his own research from across Europe.

Entrepreneurship in the Informal Economy,"Mai Thi Thanh Thai, Ekaterina Turkina",Routledge,2013-03-05,"Although entrepreneurship in the informal economy occurs outside state regulatory systems, informal commercial activities account for an estimated 30% of economic activity around the world. Informal entrepreneurship goes unmonitored despite the fact that it significantly contributes to poverty reduction and economic development. As a result, the informal sector is open to unethical practices including corruption, worker exploitation, and natural environment abuse to name just a few. In the media, debates have formed around whether informal entrepreneurship should be assisted or legitimized. Hence, a deep understanding of the phenomenon is vitally important. This book is the first on the market to offer models and approaches to informal entrepreneurship as well as to its prospects for economic development. Offering an in-depth examination of informal entrepreneurship in many different countries, it reveals the motivations for engaging in entrepreneurship in the informal economy, characteristics of informal entrepreneurship, and informal entrepreneurs’ response to ethical issues. This volume illustrates the relationship between formal and informal economies and the conditions for the benefits of informal entrepreneurship to outweigh its disadvantages. And finally, it gives recommendations about when and how the informal economy can be formalized, which sectors should be formalized, and which ones can remain informal. This book offers much-needed guidance for stakeholders involved in economic development programs and scholars and entrepreneurs interested in the field of informal entrepreneurship as it is developing around the globe.",1135076251,9781135076252,303,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BHcIEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=BHcIEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=270&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BHcIEQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api
Teaching Entrepreneurship,"Heidi M. Neck, Patricia G. Greene, Candida G.

Offering a set of 42 exercises with detailed teaching notes, this book is written for those educators who want their students to develop a bias for action and who are willing to explore new approaches in their own classrooms. 'Of course, entrepreneurship can be taught, and this books shows how.

This is partly due to the renowned reputations of the three authors, but more so because the contents speak so clearly to various forms of experiential education common within our field of practice.

Context Matters,"Peter J. Boettke, Christopher J. Coyne",Now Publishers Inc,2009,"Context Matters: Institutions and Entrepreneurship analyzes the connection between entrepreneurship and institutions. The goal is to provide a discussion of the literature on institutions in economics, develop the argument on the relationship between institutions and entrepreneurship and apply this logic to a variety of entrepreneurial settings - private for-profit, private non-profit and political. In addition to exploring entrepreneurship within several institutional settings, the authors also consider entrepreneurship on institutional arrangements. Context Matters: Institutions and Entrepreneurship develops the notion of institutions and provide insight into what this concept entails. The authors show how institutions matter for entrepreneurship and economic development. This if followed by a consideration of 'social entrepreneurship', 'political entrepreneurship', and the role of 'institutional entrepreneurs' and their impact on the formation and evolution of institutions.

Entrepreneurship and Innovation in Egypt,"Nagla Rizk, Hassan Azzazy",I.B.Tauris,2016-04-24,"Entrepreneurship and innovation have emerged globally as significant drivers for inclusive economic growth, contributing to both job and wealth creation. Especially since Egypt’s 2011 revolution, the need has become pressing for novel models that capitalize on the country’s human resources. Half of the Egyptian population is less than 25 years old and almost one quarter is between 18 and 29 years old. More than any other time, an entrepreneurial spirit and innovative mindset need to be fostered and encouraged to best rebuild the country’s economy on solid and sustainable foundations. This important book sheds new light on the promise of entrepreneurship and innovation in restructuring Egypt, and their potential for promoting economic development. It probes the relationship between innovation and economic growth, providing linkages between academic research and applied/industry needs. It also looks at how creativity and innovation can be embedded in the educational system, the challenges facing the entrepreneurial ecosystem, and considers ways to enhance social entrepreneurship. Covering a lot of ground, the authors propose answers and solutions, as well as laying the groundwork for further research and deliberations—in this field in general and in Egypt, at this juncture of the country’s development, in particular",1617977039,9781617977039,224,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=X7DgDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=X7DgDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=281&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=X7DgDAAAQBAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&source=gbs_api
Handbook of Research on Small Business and Entrepreneurship,"Elizabeth Chell, Mine Karataş-Özkan",Edward Elgar Publishing,2014,"This insightful Handbook focuses on behavior, performance and relationships in small and entrepreneurial firms. It introduces a variety of contemporary topics, research methods and theoretical frameworks that will provide cutting edge analysis, stimulate thought, raise further questions and demonstrate the complexity of the rapidly-advancing field of entrepreneurship. With an extensive introduction, logical sequencing and a collection of interesting and original contributions from across the globe, the Handbook commences with two thought-provoking chapters, which raise issues of theoretical framing and highlight the importance of paradigm choice, methodology and method. After considering different disciplinary approaches to entrepreneurship and small business, various issues are raised about entrepreneurship education and learning and the application of entrepreneurship to various sectors and sectional interests. For example, what conceptual framework is available for entrepreneurs and small businesses? How does innovation relate to entrepreneurship and small business behavior? And what evidence is there of the links between better performing firms and effective learning? These issues are debated before the authors consider the future application of entrepreneurship research to different sectors. Both scholars new to the area, as well as established academics looking to extend their research scope to encompass the field of entrepreneurship and small business will find this work to be an invaluable and timely resource.

Chinese Entrepreneurship,"Peter J. Peverelli, Jiwen Song",Springer,2014-06-11,"Entrepreneurship is hot. China is hot. Combining these two concepts could therefore be a dangerous act, as it may cause overheating. Chinese entrepreneurs are indeed the subject of a rapidly growing body of literature, academic and popular. However, the bulk of it tends to focus on a few aspects. There are the biographies of ‘famous’ entrepreneurs. While informative, these are usually of a non-academic nature. Academic studies tend to focus on the political and economic environment in which present day Chinese entrepreneurs have to operate. Both types of publications slight the entrepreneurial identity. This study aims at filling this gap with its core question: why do some people become entrepreneurs? The authors have analysed the life stories of a number of Chinese private entrepreneurs to reveal how the entrepreneurial identity of each of them has emerged at the cross section of an number of other identities. This book therefore contributes to a better understanding of Chinese entrepreneurship and the study of entrepreneurship in general.",3642444164,9783642444166,0,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hrbAoAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=hrbAoAEACAAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=283&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=hrbAoAEACAAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&source=gbs_api

Public Sector Entrepreneurship,"Dennis Patrick Leyden, Albert N. Link",Oxford University Press,2015-01-06,"Public sector entrepreneurship refers to innovative public policy initiatives that generate greater economic prosperity. These initiatives can transform a status quo economic environment into one that is more conducive to economic units engaging in creative and innovative activities in the face of uncertainty. Public Sector Entrepreneurship traces the historical development of the concepts of private and public sector entrepreneurship and their connection to the separate notions of risk and uncertainty. Based on a formal conceptualization of these notions, the book illustrates throughout public sector entrepreneurship in practice using examples from U.S. technology and innovation policy. Technology policy-policy to enhance the application of new knowledge, learned through science, to some known problem-and innovation policy-policy to enhance the commercialization of a technology-are quintessential examples of the public sector recognizing and exploiting opportunities to bring about change and efficiency. Using this concept of public sector entrepreneurship as the lens to view the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980, the Stevenson-Wydler Act of 1980, the R&E Tax Credit of 1981, Small Business Innovation Development Act of 1982, the National Cooperative Research Act of 1984, and the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 affords us the ability to find elements of commonality among these policies and to discuss their impact on the U.S. economy from the perspective of entrepreneurial action.",0199313865,9780199313860,265,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lhCgBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=lhCgBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=287&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lhCgBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Entrepreneurship and Behavioral Strategy (hc),Tushar Kanti Das,N/A,2020,"Behavioral strategy continues to attract increasing research interest within the broader field of strategic management. Research in behavioral strategy has clear scope for development in tandem with such traditional streams of strategy research that involve economics, markets, resources, and technology. The key roles of psychology, organizational behavior, and behavioral decision making in the theory and practice of strategy have yet to be comprehensively grasped. Given that strategic thinking and strategic decision making are importantly concerned with human cognition, human decisions, and human behavior, it makes eminent sense to bring some balance in the strategy field by complementing the extant emphasis on the ""objective"" economics-based view with substantive attention to the ""subjective"" individual-oriented perspective. This calls for more focused inquiries into the role and nature of the individual strategy actors, and their cognitions and behaviors, in the strategy research enterprise. For the purposes of this book series, behavioral strategy would be broadly construed as covering all aspects of the role of the strategy maker in the entire strategy field. The scholarship relating to behavioral strategy is widely believed to be dispersed in diverse literatures. These existing contributions that relate to behavioral strategy within the overall field of strategy has been known and perhaps valued by most scholars all along, but were not adequately appreciated or brought together as a coherent sub-field or as a distinct perspective of strategy. This book series on Research in Behavioral Strategy will cover the essential progress made thus far in this admittedly fragmented literature and elaborate upon fruitful streams of scholarship. More importantly, the book series will focus on providing a robust and comprehensive forum for the growing scholarship in behavioral strategy. In particular, the volumes in the series will cover new views of interdisciplinary theoretical frameworks and models (dealing with all behavioral aspects), significant practical problems of strategy formulation, implementation, and evaluation, and emerging areas of inquiry. The series will also include comprehensive empirical studies of selected segments of business, economic, industrial, government, and non-profit activities with potential for wider application of behavioral strategy. Through the ongoing release of focused topical titles, this book series will seek to disseminate theoretical insights and practical management information that will enable interested professionals to gain a rigorous and comprehensive understanding of the subject of behavioral strategy. Entrepreneurship and Behavioral Strategy contains contributions by leading scholars in the field of entrepreneurship with an interest in researching behavioral perspectives. The 10 chapters in this volume deal with a number of significant issues relating broadly to the behavioral aspects of entrepreneurship, covering topics such as entrepreneurial process orientation, a machine learning approach to reviewing the intersection of the entrepreneurship and behavioral strategy literatures, the temporalities of entrepreneurial risk behavior, entrepreneurs under ambiguity, disruptive business model innovations, international attention, entrepreneurial team formation, building alliances in new and small ventures, the role of insight in entrepreneurial action, and the effects of foreign competition on entrepreneurship activities. The chapters include empirical as well as conceptual treatments of the selected topics, and collectively present a wide-ranging review of the noteworthy research perspectives on the confluence of entrepreneurship and behavioral strategy.",1648020496,9781648020490,330,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_wBtzQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=_wBtzQEACAAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=289&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=_wBtzQEACAAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&source=gbs_api
Entrepreneurship in the Region,"Michael Fritsch, Jürgen Schmude",Springer,2010-11-19,"Entrepreneurship in the Region approaches many different aspects of entrepreneurship from a regional perspective. The regional influences on entrepreneurship analyzed entail regional peculiarities and disparities in new business formation processes, the success and the employment effects of new firms, the importance of social capital and of network structures as well as entrepreneurship education and training provided in the regions. The articles in this book provide strong evidence for the importance of regional factors that shape entrepreneurship and new firm formation processes. It is shown that regional differences of start-up rates and entrepreneurial attitudes are not at all elusive but tend to be rather persistent and prevail over longer periods of time. The evidence clearly suggests that the regional level can be an appropriate starting point for entrepreneurship policy and that research on the issue may considerably benefit from properly accounting for the spatial dimension.",1441939393,9781441939395,0,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fVCtcQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=fVCtcQAACAAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=290&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=fVCtcQAACAAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&source=gbs_api

Emerging work on entrepreneurial ecosystems suggests it is important entrepreneurship studies move beyond the mere identification of factors that impact entrepreneurial activity to consider the unique geographic contexts in which entrepreneurs operate. These contexts include a variety of interactive elements including regional characteristics, institutions, actors, and connectors. As such, this collection analyses entrepreneurial activity in regions around the globe. The contributions explore a series of diverse regions in terms of their geographic, historical, industrial, and institutional contexts. The book also explores a range of topics, such as patterns of regional/subnational variations in entrepreneurial activity, geographically mediated determinants of entrepreneurship, inter-temporal dynamics, evolution of regional systems of entrepreneurship, and the impact of entrepreneurship on regional development and regional entrepreneurship policy.

Entrepreneurship and Small Business,"Michael Schaper, Thierry Volery",John Wiley & Sons,2004-01-07,"Entrepreneurship and small business management are two very close and often overlapping disciplines. Entrepreneurship refers to the dynamic process of creating a new business venture. Small business management addresses various issues of organizing and operating a small business.

"Are Entrepreneurship, Research and Management a Remedy for Unemployment and Poverty in Botswana?",Nametsegang Tonkope,GRIN Verlag,2019-04-30,"Doctoral Thesis / Dissertation from the year 2018 in the subject Economics - Job market economics, grade: 4,00, ( Atlantic International University ) (Atlantic International University), course: Business and Economics, language: English, abstract: This study looks at entrepreneurship, research and business management education which can be used as remedies for unemployment and poverty in Botswana. Research has shown a worldwide continual growth of entrepreneurial education in higher institutions. Though some researchers paid more attention on entrepreneurship education, this has been based on teaching entrepreneurship as an embedded unit in different programmes, which does not fully equip learners with relevant skills into starting their own businesses. Entrepreneurship, research and business management programmes would benefit potential graduates’ entrepreneurs in their quest to engage in entrepreneurial activities. Like other developing countries, Botswana is striving to build a knowledge based. Quite a large number of graduates and those who were not privileged to go through tertiary education are unemployed which results in an increase on poverty cases. The situation is pitiable as universities, tertiary institutions and brigades are producing a large number of graduates annually and these graduates have no place to go. Research shows that, unemployment is a problem as it encourages poverty, hooliganism, robberies, house breakings, prostitution and political instability just to mention a few. One of the factors to consider for the business to succeed is training and education of staff. This study aims to find out if a standalone programme on entrepreneurship, including research and business management could be another means of encouraging entrepreneurship and innovation in the country, targeting those who are interested in entrepreneurship as offered as a post graduate programme.",3668929831,9783668929838,133,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cemVDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=cemVDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=303&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=cemVDwAAQBAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&source=gbs_api
"Government, SMEs and Entrepreneurship Development",Robert A. Blackburn,Routledge,2016-04-22,"Recent decades have seen substantial growth in the range of assistance programmes for SMEs and entrepreneurs across the world. Once regarded as peripheral to the economy and public policy, the role of small firms and of entrepreneurship is now recognized as of key importance in the economic growth and development strategies of many nations. The range of interventions and support focused on promoting SMEs and entrepreneurship is substantial and expanding, so Government, SMEs and Entrepreneurship Development asks ’what are some of the main policy instruments being used, and how effective are they?’ It considers policies in different countries, examines key interventions and tools used to promote entrepreneurship and SME development and concludes with contributions on how to best evaluate their effectiveness. The contributor chapters by academics and practitioners from businesses, enterprise development agencies and governments, are empirical or evidence-based and use both quantitative and qualitative approaches. Drawing on experience from a wide range of both developed and emerging countries and economies, the contributions focus on the broad strategies that different governments and communities have adopted to foster entrepreneurship and SMEs; the policy tools and instruments that can be used to promote small business and entrepreneurship; and on the outcomes of policy instruments and the methods used to evaluate interventions. Their findings will help researchers, policy-makers, economic development officers, civil servants, elected officials, and business associations to better understand the issues in this important field.",1317125347,9781317125341,312,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cmwGDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=cmwGDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=304&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=cmwGDAAAQBAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&source=gbs_api
Co-Innovation Competence,Benedict C. Doepfer,Springer Gabler,2012-12-08,​This work contributes to entrepreneurship research and offers practical implications for entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship promotors by critically analyzing a networked approach to value creation processes of young knowledge-intensive entrepreneurial firms and assessing precise strategies and tactics for entrepreneurial firms to exploit these structures. In this context the concept of co-innovation competence is introduced and empirically analyzed. Results indicate that entrepreneurs follow a specific approach towards networking minimizing transaction costs taking an on-demand-based perspective of networking. In this case entrepreneurs may relate to regional innovation promotors and also reach beyond regional structures to explore suitable partners and exploit structural holes.,3658002565,9783658002565,274,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AzwljgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=AzwljgEACAAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=305&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=AzwljgEACAAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&source=gbs_api

"Entrepreneurship, Human Capital, and Regional Development","Rui Baptista, João Leitão",Springer,2015-01-18,"This book makes original contributions to the literature on clusters, human capital, and regional development by focusing on the link between entrepreneurship and economic growth, aiming for a better understanding of the dynamics of growth determined by the entrepreneur’s action in the regional space. The focus is therefore on critical reflection and rethinking the articulation between three levels of analysis of economic systems, namely entrepreneurship, human capital and regional development, which have not so far been perfectly articulated in the literature of reference on endogenous growth. Although there has been significant research so far into the success and failure of clusters, the implications of these multiple research efforts fail to provide political decision-makers and company managers with critical information about which mechanisms lie behind cluster success and also about how clusters survive and prosper. The innovative approaches presented in this book on entrepreneurship, human capital mobility and regional development have considerable potential to create new and original implications for decision-makers and managers. In terms of value added, this book contributes to the literature by seeking answers to the following questions: (i) Is the growth and success of clusters over time due to concentration and transmission of business competences through spin-offs located in a given regional space? (ii) Does increased density of job options outside the workplace contribute to increased mobility of human capital between firms located within clusters, and so improve coordination in the local labor market? (iii) Do spin-offs benefit from hiring workers from successful incumbents, inasmuch as those workers are expected to perform better than other workers from different origins? Integrating theoretical frameworks, empirical research, and regional case studies (from Portugal, Spain, Norway and Turkey), the editors and contributors demonstrate that the regional dynamics of industry growth are strongly influenced by the mobility of employees towards new firms.",3319128728,9783319128726,401,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bc34sgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=bc34sgEACAAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=308&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=bc34sgEACAAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&source=gbs_api

Technological Entrepreneurship,Ian Chaston,Palgrave Macmillan,2017-02-13,"This comprehensive book responds to the growing demand to study entrepreneurship as a key driver of innovation and competitive advantage. Challenging the existing idea that technological entrepreneurship exists predominantly in SMEs and as a result of market demands, the author argues that a commitment to entrepreneurship remains the most effective strategy for sustaining wealth generation for both organisations and entire nations. The aim of Technological Entrepreneurship is to provide the reader with additional knowledge and understanding of the concepts associated with the exploitation of technological entrepreneurship, and to demonstrate how associated management principles are somewhat different to those utilised in market-driven entrepreneurship. Validation of presented theoretical concepts is achieved through coverage of processes and practices utilised by real world organisations seeking to achieve maximum wealth generation, with specific emphasis on how technological entrepreneurship is the source of disruptive innovation within service sector organisations and how the philosophy is causing fundamental change in the provision of healthcare.",3319458493,9783319458496,0,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Y_4gvgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=Y_4gvgAACAAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=311&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=Y_4gvgAACAAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&source=gbs_api

International Entrepreneurship,A. Coskun Samli,Springer,2010-08-18,"Despite the accelerating pace of globalization, it is impossible to ignore the marginalization of the developing world, as billions of people continue to slip deeper into poverty. While many theories, policies, and practices have been proposed to help redress the disparities between the ""haves"" and the ""have-nots,"" only recently have proponents of sustainable economic development and entrepreneurship discovered each other. In this provocative and timely book, A. Coskun Samli fills the gap by making the connections explicit and arguing that entrepreneurship may be the only hope for countries that have fallen into the trap of relying on foreign aid and bowing to the pressures of multinational conglomerates driven by short-term profit-maximizing goals. Samli builds the case that some cultures are more entrepreneurial than others, and demonstrates the importance of creating the right conditions, infrastructure, policies, and educational systems that inspire and support new business creation.",1441973826,9781441973825,0,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fTCybwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=fTCybwAACAAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=313&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=fTCybwAACAAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&source=gbs_api
"Institutions, Entrepreneurship, and Economic Performance","David Urbano, Sebastian Aparicio, David B. Audretsch",Springer,2020-08-15,"Using institutional economics as a theoretical framework, this book analyzes institutional environment conducive to entrepreneurial activity in order to enhance economic performance across countries. In particular, the main contributions of this book to the entrepreneurship literature are the following: • Identify past and current research about the institutional context shaping entrepreneurial activity and its effect on economic growth • Examine social progress orientation as those institutional factors that are shaping innovative entrepreneurial activity • Explore the effect of different types of entrepreneurial activities on economic growth • Examine how social progress orientation through opportunity-driven entrepreneurship affects economic development • Analyze the interrelationships between institutions, entrepreneurial activity and economic development across countries • Study how the country's institutional context influences the way in which entrepreneurial activity affects social progress Two sides of the same coin might be observed when analyzing policy aspects of those institutions affecting entrepreneurial activity. On the one hand, effective public policy to promote entrepreneurship is predicated on understanding the underlying forces as well as the consequences and impacts of entrepreneurship. On the other hand, different endeavors to promote entrepreneurial activity might have deleterious economic effects since they could actually reduce employment in the long-term. Thus, it is crucial to understand the institutional environment in which entrepreneurs are interacting and making decisions. The comprehension of these phenomena serves to move forward the theoretical, practical and policy debate on entrepreneurship as a mechanism to achieve higher economic performance.",3030133753,9783030133757,240,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=H3sjygEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=H3sjygEACAAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=314&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=H3sjygEACAAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&source=gbs_api

A must-read for all those interested in family firm entrepreneurship.Õ Ð Andrew Popp, University of Liverpool Management School, UK Entrepreneurship across Generations examines dimensions of identity, gender and learning to understand the complex fabric of family business. An interpretation of narratives from two generations in five families constitutes entrepreneurship as an inherently social, rather than individual, phenomenon. This enriching book explains how entrepreneurial capacity is shared between generations, showing how learning is embedded within everyday social practice in the family and the business. It explores patriarchal practice and gendered entrepreneurial identities in family business. The author challenges dominant discourses of entrepreneurship. She argues that entrepreneurial identities are mediated by narrative and subject to constant negotiation within and across generations. With a new perspective on entrepreneurship, this insightful study will be essential and supplementary reading for students and practitioners within the field of entrepreneurship and family business.",184980625X,9781849806251,197,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zYKp67glkW4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=zYKp67glkW4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=319&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zYKp67glkW4C&source=gbs_api
Subsistence Entrepreneurship,"Vanessa Ratten, Paul Jones, Vitor Braga, Carla Susana Marques",Springer,2019-05-07,"This book focuses on the role of subsistence entrepreneurs in creating social and sustainable business opportunities on the global marketplace. Subsistence entrepreneurs use scarce resources to create new business opportunities, often in developing or emerging economies. In addition, subsistence entrepreneurship is increasingly being used as a way to facilitate market entry for small and medium-sized business enterprises that focus on collaborative innovation. The interdisciplinary contributions gathered here will expand readers’ understanding of the nature and characteristics of subsistence entrepreneurs, as well as the challenges they face. The central connection between subsistence, sustainability and social entrepreneurship is also explored.",3030115410,9783030115418,237,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QvJavwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=QvJavwEACAAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=320&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=QvJavwEACAAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&source=gbs_api
Entrepreneurship in India,Alexander Newman,Routledge,2021,"""The economic liberalization in India over the last three decades has provided a wealth of opportunity for entrepreneurs looking to start and expand their businesses. Since the economy opened up in the 1990s, entrepreneurial activity in the private sector has been largely responsible for the strong economic growth experienced in the country. India is presently the world's third largest source of start-ups, and was ranked the second most entrepreneurial country in the world in the recent Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) report, ahead of large economic powerhouses such as the United States, China and the UK. Entrepreneurship in India looks at the dynamic and changing nature of entrepreneurship in India. The book examines the history of entrepreneurship in India, different entrepreneurship models adopted, the entrepreneurial ecosystem and looks at the future of entrepreneurship in the country. This book will benefit business people, policy makers and researchers looking to understand more about entrepreneurship in India, and offers guidance to foreign business looking to engage with entrepreneurs in India""--",1003047289,9781003047285,188,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=k_pszgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=k_pszgEACAAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=321&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=k_pszgEACAAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&source=gbs_api

As the entrepreneurship field matures, it is important to identify the novel contributions that will help shape the next decades of scholarship, by providing scholars with the concepts, frameworks, and approaches needed to help develop the new theories and practices of entrepreneurship. By focusing on emerging key contributions, this book takes a stance that sets it apart from other similar works by scholars that have focused only on existing themes rather than those that will characterize the relationship between entrepreneurship and new technological advances, growing inequalities, gender, diversity and inclusion, and socio-political shifts in the landscape of entrepreneurial ecosystems, allowing for critical and new conversations on entrepreneurship to take shape.

Steeltown U.S.A,"Sherry Lee Linkon, John Russo",N/A,2002,"Once the symbol of a robust steel industry and blue-collar economy, Youngstown, Ohio, and its famous Jeannette Blast Furnace have become key icons in the tragic tale of American deindustrialization. Sherry Lee Linkon and John Russo examine the inevitable tension between those discordant visions, which continue to exert great power over Steeltown's citizens as they struggle to redefine their lives. When the Jenny was shut down in 1978, 50,000 Youngstown workers lost their jobs, cutting the heart out of the local economy. Even as the community organized a nationally recognized effort to save the mills, the city was rocked by economic devastation, runaway crime, and mob scandal, problems that persist twenty-five years later. In the midst of these struggles the Jenny remained standing as a proud symbol of the community's glory days, still a dominant force in the construction of both individual and collective identities in Youngstown. Focusing on stories and images that both reflect and perpetuate how Youngstown understands itself as a community, Sherry Lee Linkon and John Russo have forged a historical and cultural study of the relationship between community, memory, work, and confli",N/A,N/A,310,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MvgTAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=MvgTAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA288&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=330&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=MvgTAAAAYAAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&source=gbs_api

Nontimber Forest Products in the United States,"Eric T. Jones, Rebecca Jean McLain, James F. Weigand",N/A,2002,"A quiet revolution is taking place in America's forests. Once seen primarily as stands of timber, our woodlands are now prized as a rich source of a wide range of commodities, from wild mushrooms and maple sugar to hundreds of medicinal plants whose uses have only begun to be fully realized. Now as timber harvesting becomes more mechanized and requires less labor, the image of the lumberjack is being replaced by that of the forager. This book provides the first comprehensive examination of nontimber forest products (NTFPs) in the United States, illustrating their diverse importance, describing the people who harvest them, and outlining the steps that are being taken to ensure access to them. As the first extensive national overview of NTFP policy and management specific to the United States, it brings together research from numerous disciplines and analytical perspectives-such as economics, mycology, history, ecology, law, entomology, forestry, geography, and anthropology—in order to provide a cohesive picture of the current and potential role of NTFPs. The contributors review the state of scientific knowledge of NTFPs by offering a survey of commercial and noncommercial products, an overview of uses and users, and discussions of sustainable management issues associated with ecology, cultural traditions, forest policy, and commerce. They examine some of the major social, economic, and biological benefits of NTFPs, while also addressing the potential negative consequences of NTFP harvesting on forest ecosystems and on NTFP species populations. Within this wealth of information are rich accounts of NTFP use drawn from all parts of the American landscape—from the Pacific Northwest to the Caribbean. From honey production to a review of nontimber forest economies still active in the United States—such as the Ojibway ""harvest of plants"" recounted here—the book takes in the whole breadth of recent NTFP issues, including ecological concerns associated with the expansion of NTFP markets and NTFP tenure issues on federally managed lands. No other volume offers such a comprehensive overview of NTFPs in North America. By examining all aspects of these products, it contributes to the development of more sophisticated policy and management frameworks for not only ensuring their ongoing use but also protecting the future of our forests.",N/A,N/A,478,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VbwsAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=VbwsAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA101&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=336&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=VbwsAQAAMAAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&source=gbs_api
The Supreme Court in American Politics,"Howard Gillman, Cornell W. Clayton",N/A,1999,"For decades political scientists studying the Court have adopted behavioral approaches and focused on the relatively narrow question of how the justices' policy preferences influence their voting behavior. This emphasis has illuminated important aspects of Supreme Court politics, but it has also left unaddressed many other important questions about this unique and fascinating institution. Drawing on ""the new institutionalism"" in the social sciences, the distinguished contributors to this volume attempt to fill this gap by exploring a variety of topics, including the Court's institutional development and its relationship to broader political contexts such as party regimes, electoral systems, social movements, social change, legal precedents, political identities, and historically evolving economic structures. The book's initial chapters examine the nature of the Court's distinctive norms as well as the development of its institutional powers and practice. A second section relates the development of Supreme Court politics to the historical development of other political institutions and social movements. Concluding chapters explore how its decision making in particular areas of law or periods of time is influenced by—and influences—its socio-political milieu. These contributions offer provocative insights regarding the Court's role in maintaining or disrupting political and economic structures, as well as social structures and identities tied to ideology, class, race, gender, and sexual orientation. The Supreme Court in American Politics shows how we can develop an enriched understanding of this institution, and open up exciting new areas of research by placing it in the broader context of politics in the United States.",N/A,N/A,328,Law,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=C27uAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=C27uAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA232&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=337&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=C27uAAAAMAAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&source=gbs_api
Ghost Settlement on the Prairie,Joseph V. Hickey,Rural America,1995,"Four miles southeast of the village of Matfield Green in Chase County, Kansas—the heart of the Flint Hills—lies the abandoned settlement of Thurman. At the turn of the century Thurman was a prosperous farming and ranching settlement with fifty-one households, a post office, two general stores, a blacksmith shop, five schools, and a church. Today, only the ruins of Thurman remain. Joseph Hickey uses Thurman to explore the settlement form of social organization, which—along with the village, hamlet, and small town—was a dominant feature of nineteenth- and early twentieth-century American life. He traces Thurman's birth in 1874, its shallow rises and falls, and its demise in 1944. Akin to what William Least Heat-Moon did for Chase County in PrairyErth, Hicky provides a ""deep map"" for one post-office community and, consequently, tells us a great deal about America's rural past. Describing the shifting relationships between Thurmanites and their Matfield Green neighbors, Hickey details how social forces set in motion by the American ideal of individualism and the machinations of capitalist entrepreneurs produced a Darwinian struggle between Thurman stock raisers and Flint Hills ""cattle barons"" that ultimately doomed Thurman. Central to the story are the concept of ""ordinary entrepreneurship"" and the profoundly capitalist attitudes of the farmers who settled Thurman and thousands of other communities dotting the American landscape. Hickey's account of Thurman's social organization and disintegration provides a new perspective on what happened when the cattle drives from Texas and the Southwest shifted in the 1880s from the Kansas cowtowns to the Flint Hills. Moreover, he punctures numerous myths about the Flint Hills, including those that cattle dominated because the land is too rocky to farm or that Indians refused to farm because of traditional beliefs. Like many other small rural communities, Hickey argues, Thurman during its seventy-year history was actually several different settlements. A product of changing social conditions, each one resulted from shifting memberships and boundaries that reflected the efforts of local entrepreneurs to use country schools, churches, and other forms of ""social capital"" to gain advantages over their competitors. In the end, Thurman succumbed to the impact of agribusiness, which had the effect of transforming social capital from an asset into a liability. Ultimately, Hickey shows, the settlement's fate echoed the decline of rural community throughout America.",N/A,N/A,352,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=khN6AAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=khN6AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA256&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=338&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=khN6AAAAMAAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&source=gbs_api

The Politicizing Presidency,Thomas J. Weko,N/A,1995,"From Truman to Clinton presidents have aggressively tried to expand their control over national government. In the process, they have vastly enlarged their White House staffs and politicized the federal bureaucracy with thousands of appointees in key administrative positions. Thomas Weko argues that the Presidential Personnel Office (PPO), charged with screening and recommending such appointees, both exemplifies and helps explain the enormous growth of presidential power since World War II. Originally conceived as a small advisory group within the White House Office, the PPO has grown enormously from a staff of two under Truman to as many as sixty under other presidents and now oversees nearly four thousand appointments per administration. Weko charts the PPO's evolution and influence and shows how central it is to our understanding of modern presidential leadership. Weko's starting point is Terry Moe's rational choice theory that it is the institution of the presidency, not the sitting president, that fosters centralization and politicization within the executive branch. Amplifying and extending Moe's theory, Weko persuasively links the PPO's explosive growth to the weakening of political parties, the post-Eisenhower disintegration of ""policy networks,"" the growing impact of television news, and the public's increasing readiness to hold the President accountable for policy failures. The PPO's growth clearly has increased presidential control and bureaucratic responsiveness. But Weko argues those results have had unanticipated and unwanted consequences that, among other things, have undermined the integrity and capabilities of administrative agencies. Any improvement in the leadership of the executive branch, he contends, can only emerge from changes in the current institutional arrangement of the presidency itself. Based on exhaustive research in White House files, oral histories, and memoirs, and personal interviews with over 100 White House aides, Weko's study provides a provocative new look at the White House Office and the modern presidency.",N/A,N/A,248,Biography & Autobiography,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Sh6HAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=Sh6HAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA197&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=375&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=Sh6HAAAAMAAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&source=gbs_api

Devil's Bargains,Hal Rothman,N/A,1998,"The West is popularly perceived as America's last outpost of unfettered opportunity, but twentieth-century corporate tourism has transformed it into America's ""land of opportunism."" From Sun Valley to Santa Fe, towns throughout the West have been turned over to outsiders—and not just to those who visit and move on, but to those who stay and control. Although tourism has been a blessing for many, bringing economic and cultural prosperity to communities without obvious means of support or allowing towns on the brink of extinction to renew themselves; the costs on more intangible levels may be said to outweigh the benefits and be a devil's bargain in the making. Hal Rothman examines the effect of twentieth-century tourism on the West and exposes that industry's darker side. He tells how tourism evolved from Grand Canyon rail trips to Sun Valley ski weekends and Disneyland vacations, and how the post-World War II boom in air travel and luxury hotels capitalized on a surge in discretionary income for many Americans, combined with newfound leisure time. From major destinations like Las Vegas to revitalized towns like Aspen and Moab, Rothman reveals how the introduction of tourism into a community may seem innocuous, but residents gradually realize, as they seek to preserve the authenticity of their communities, that decision-making power has subtly shifted from the community itself to the newly arrived corporate financiers. And because tourism often results in a redistribution of wealth and power to ""outsiders,"" observes Rothman, it represents a new form of colonialism for the region. By depicting the nature of tourism in the American West through true stories of places and individuals that have felt its grasp, Rothman doesn't just document the effects of tourism but provides us with an enlightened explanation of the shape these changes take. Deftly balancing historical perspective with an eye for what's happening in the region right now, his book sets new standards for the study of tourism and is one that no citizen of the West whose life is touched by that industry can afford to ignore.",N/A,N/A,456,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vwSAAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=vwSAAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA210&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=386&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=vwSAAAAAMAAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&source=gbs_api

Regime Politics,Clarence Nathan Stone,N/A,1989,"From the end of Georgia's white primary in 1946 to the present, Atlanta has been a community of growing black electoral strength and stable white economic power. Yet the ballot box and investment money never became opposing weapons in a battle for domination. Instead, Atlanta experienced the emergence and evolution of a biracial coalition. Although beset by changing conditions and significant cost pressures, this coalition has remained intact. At critical junctures forces of cooperation overcame antagonisms of race and ideology. While retaining a critical distance from rational choice theory, author Clarence Stone finds the problem of collective action to be centrally important. The urban condition in America is one of weak and diffuse authority, and this situation favors any group that can act cohesively and control a substantial body of resources. Those endowed with a capacity to promote cooperation can attract allies and overcome oppositional forces. On the negative side of the political ledger, Atlanta's style of civic cooperation is achieved at a cost. Despite an ambitious program of physical redevelopment, the city is second only to Newark, New Jersey, in the poverty rate. Social problems, conflict of interest issues, and inattention to the production potential of a large lower class bespeak a regime unable to address a wide range of human needs. No simple matter of elite domination, it is a matter of governing arrangements built out of selective incentives and inside deal-making; such arrangements can serve only limited purposes. The capacity of urban regimes to bring about elaborate forms of physical redevelopment should not blind us to their incapacity to address deeply rooted social problems. Stone takes the historical approach seriously. The flow of events enables us to see how some groups deploy their resource advantages to fashion governing arrangements to their liking. But no one enjoys a completely free hand; some arrangements are more workable than others. Stone's theory-minded analysis of key events enables us to ask why and what else might be done. Regime Politics offers readers a political history of postwar Atlanta and an elegant, innovative, and incisive conceptual framework destined to influence the way urban politics is studied.",N/A,N/A,336,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bEITAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=bEITAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA309&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=389&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=bEITAAAAYAAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&source=gbs_api

"School Reform, Corporate Style",Dorothy Shipps,N/A,2006,"Like other big city school systems, Chicago's has been repeatedly ""reformed"" over the last century. Yet its schools have fallen far short of citizens' expectations and left a gap between the performances of white and minority students. Many blame the educational establishment for resisting change. Other critics argue that reform occurs too often; still others claim it comes not often enough. Dorothy Shipps reappraises the tumultuous history of educational progress in Chicago, revealing that the persistent lack of improvement is due not to the extent but rather the type of reform. Throughout the twentieth century, managerial reorganizations initiated by the business community repeatedly altered the governance structure of schools—as well as the relationships of teachers to children and parents—but brought little improvement, while other more promising reform models were either resisted or crowded out. Shipps chronicles how Chicago's corporate actors led, abetted, or restrained nearly every attempt to transform the city's school system, then asks whether schools might be better reformed by others. To show why city schools have failed urban children so badly, she traces Chicago's reform history over four political eras, revealing how corporate power was instrumental in designing and revamping the system. Her narrative encompasses the formative era of 1880-1930, when teachers' unions moderated business plans; previously unexplored business activism from 1930 to 1980, when civil rights dominated school reform, and the decentralization of the 1980s. She also covers the uneasy cooperation among business associations in the 1990s to install the mayor as head of the school system, a governing regime now challenged by privatization advocates. Business people may be too wedded to a stunted view of educators to forge a productive partnership for change. Unionized teachers bridle at the second-class status accorded them by managers. If reform is to reach deeply into classrooms, Shipps concludes, it might well require a new coalition of teachers' unions and parents to create a fresh agenda that supersedes corporate interests. This study clearly shows that, in Chicago as elsewhere, urban schooling is intertwined with politics and power. By reviewing more than a century of corporate efforts to make education work, Shipps makes a strong case that it's high time to look elsewhere—perhaps to educators themselves—for new leadership.",N/A,N/A,320,Education,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_9KeAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=_9KeAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA120&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=392&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=_9KeAAAAMAAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&source=gbs_api

John Brown to Bob Dole,Virgil W. Dean,N/A,2006,"From radical abolitionist John Brown to presidential candidate Bob Dole to visionary environmentalist Wes Jackson, Kansas history is bursting with fascinating stories of individuals who made a difference to the nation and whose lives reveal much about our collective past. Prominent Kansas historian Virgil Dean has gathered a distinguished team of writers--Thomas Isern, Craig Miner, and others--who have crafted incisive portraits of 27 notable men and women, covering 150 years of Kansas and American history. Here are agitators who moved their fellow citizens to action over political, social, and economic problems: not only John Brown, but also proslavery agitator William H. Russell; Mary Elizabeth Lease, lecturer for the Farmers' Alliance and Populist Party; Gerald B. Winrod, a.k.a. the ""Jayhawk Hitler""; and Esther Brown, who challenged segregation in public schools. Here, too, are motivators, like women's rights activist Clarina I.H. Nicholas; William Allen White, the ""Sage of Emporia""; and favorite sons Dwight D. Eisenhower and Bob Dole. Then there are the innovators, from trailblazers like Joseph G. McCoy, who changed the face of the cattle industry, and wheat king Theodore C. Henry to Wes Jackson, a pioneer in the sustainable agriculture movement, and the multitalented Gordon Parks, photographer, filmmaker, and author of The Learning Tree. Reformers and preachers, publishers and artists, these fascinating personalities are brought vividly back to life by Dean and his fellow authors. They offer a fresh and engaging look at many of the important themes of Kansas history--especially the state's identification with some of the great radical movements, including abolitionism, populism, and civil rights--and ultimately recapture the true spirit of Kansas and its meaning for the rest of the nation.",N/A,N/A,432,Biography & Autobiography,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Cmp6AAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=Cmp6AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA396&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=394&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=Cmp6AAAAMAAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&source=gbs_api
The Idea of Democracy in the Modern Era,Ralph Ketcham,N/A,2004,"Although the last half of the twentieth century has been called the Age of Democracy, the twenty-first has already demonstrated the fragility of its apparent triumph as the dominant form of government throughout the world. Reassessing the fate of democracy for our time, distinguished political theorist Ralph Ketcham traces the evolution of this idea over the course of four hundred years. He traces democracy's bumpy ride in a book that is both an exercise in the history of ideas and an explication of democratic theory. Ketcham examines the rationales for democratic government, identifies the fault lines that separate democracy from good government, and suggests ways to strengthen it in order to meet future challenges. Drawing on an encyclopedic command of history and politics, he examines the rationales that have been offered for democratic government over the course of four manifestations of modernity that he identifies in the Western and East Asian world since 1600. Ketcham first considers the fundamental axioms established by theorists of the Enlightenment—Bacon, Locke, Jefferson—and reflected in America's founding, then moves on to the mostly post-Darwinian critiques by Bentham, Veblen, Dewey, and others that produced theories of the liberal corporate state. He explains late-nineteenth-century Asian responses to democracy as the third manifestation, grounded in Confucian respect for communal and hierarchical norms, followed by late-twentieth-century postmodernist thought that views democratic states as oppressive and seeks to empower marginalized groups. Ketcham critiques the first, second, and fourth modernity rationales for democracy and suggests that the Asian approach may represent a reconciliation of ancient wisdom and modern science better suited to today's world. He advocates a reorientation of democracy that de-emphasizes group or identity politics and restores the wholeness of the civic community, proposing a return to the Jeffersonian universalism—that which informed the founding of the United States-if democracy is to flourish in a fifth manifestation. The Idea of Democracy in the Modern Era is an erudite, interdisciplinary work of great breadth and complexity that looks to the past in order to reframe the future. With its global overview and comparative insights, it will stimulate discussion of how democracy can survive—and thrive—in the coming era.",N/A,N/A,320,Philosophy,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=92CDAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=92CDAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA129&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=395&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=92CDAAAAMAAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&source=gbs_api

Many Wests,"David M. Wrobel, Michael C. Steiner",N/A,1997,"What does it mean to live in the West today? Do people tend to identify with states, with regions, or with the larger West? This book examines the development of regional identity in the American West, demonstrating that it is a regionally diverse entity made up of many different wests--Great Plains, Southwest, Rocky Mountains, and more--in which American regionalism finds its fullest expression. These fourteen original essays tell how a sense of place emerged among residents of various regions and how a sense of those places was developed by people outside of them. Wrobel and Steiner first offer a compelling overview of the West's regional nature; then thirteen other rising or renowned scholars-from history, American Studies, geography, and literature-tell how regional consciousness formed among inhabitants of particular regions. All of the essays address the larger issue of the centrality of place in determining social and cultural forms and individual and collective identities. Some focus on race and culture as the primary influences on regional consciousness while others emphasize environmental and economic factors or the influence of literature. Some even examine western regionalism in areas that lie beyond the West as it has traditionally been conceived. Each of the contributors believes that where a people live helps determine what they are, and they write not only about the many wests within the larger West, but also about the constant state of flux in which regionalism exists. Many books speak of the West as a place, but few others deal with the West's different places. Many Wests presents a vision of the West that reflects both the common heritage and unique character of each major subregion, building on the revisionist impulse of the last decade to help redirect New Western History toward an appreciation of regional diversity and integrate scholarship in the regional subfields. It is a book for everyone who lives in, studies, or loves the West, for it confirms that it is home to very different peoples, economies, histories-and regions.",N/A,N/A,408,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=onR5AAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=onR5AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA229&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=398&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=onR5AAAAMAAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&source=gbs_api

Presidential Leadership in Political Time,Stephen Skowronek,N/A,2008,"""Renowned scholar Stephen Skowronek's insights have fundamentally altered our understanding of the American presidency. His seminal works have identified broad historical patterns in American politics and explained the dynamics at work behind them. His ""political time"" thesis has been particularly influential, revealing how presidents reckon with the work of their predecessors, situate their power within recent political events, and assert their authority to change things. In this new book, Skowronek revisits his political time thesis and focuses on how it helps us make sense of the presidencies of Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. The essays--some of which predate his book The Politics Presidents Make, some of which followed it, and one of which is wholly original to this volume--make his arguments about the politics of leadership generally accessible while also drawing them forward and highlighting new issues for our times. Skowronek explains the typical political problems that presidents confront in political time, as well as the likely effects of their working through them. This allows him to draw out parallels in the politics of leadership between Andrew Jackson and Franklin Roosevelt and between James Polk and John Kennedy--and to develop a new and revealing perspective on the leadership of George W. Bush. All along the way, Skowronek considers contemporary innovations in the American political system that bear on the leadership patterns he draws from the more distant past. The impact of the 24-hour news cycle, of a more disciplined and homogeneous Republican party, of conservative advocacy of the ""unitary theory"" of the executive, and of progressivedisillusionment with the presidency--all come under fresh scrutiny. A provocative review of presidential history, Skowronek's book brims with fresh insights and opens a window on the institution of the executive office and the workings of the American political system as a whole. Intellectually satisfying for scholars, it also provides an accessible volume for students and general readers interested in the American presidency."" -- Publisher.",N/A,N/A,212,Biography & Autobiography,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=45EoAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=45EoAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA17&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=406&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=45EoAQAAMAAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&source=gbs_api

The Treason Trials of Aaron Burr,Peter Charles Hoffer,N/A,2008,"""Aaron Burr was an enigma even in his own day. Founding Father and vice president, he engaged in a duel with Alexander Hamilton, resulting in a murder indictment that effectively ended his legal career. And when he turned his attention to entrepreneurial activities on the frontier he was suspected of empire building - and worse."" ""In the first book dedicated to this important case, Peter Charles Hoffer unveils a cast of characters ensnared by politics and law at the highest levels of government, including President Thomas Jefferson - one of Burr's bitterest enemies - and Chief Justice John Marshall, no fan of either Burr or Jefferson. Hoffer recounts how Jefferson's prosecutors argued that the mere act of discussing an ""overt Act of War"" - the constitution's definition of treason - was tantamount to committing the act. Marshall, however, ruled that without the overt act, no treasonable action had occurred and neither discussion nor conspiracy could be prosecuted. Subsequent attempts to convict Burr on violations of the Neutrality Act failed as well.""--BOOK JACKET.",N/A,N/A,236,Biography & Autobiography,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kqYVAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=kqYVAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA5&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=409&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=kqYVAQAAIAAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&source=gbs_api
Changing Urban Education,Clarence Nathan Stone,N/A,1998,"With critical issues like desegregation and funding facing our schools, dissatisfaction with public education has reached a new high. Teachers decry inadequate resources while critics claim educators are more concerned with job security than effective teaching. Though urban education has reached crisis proportions, contending players have difficulty agreeing on a common program of action. This book tells why. Changing Urban Education confronts the prevailing naivete in school reform by examining the factors that shape, reinforce, or undermine reform efforts. Edited by one of the nation's leading urban scholars, it examines forces for change and resistance in urban education and proposes that the barrier to reform can only be overcome by understanding how schools fit into the broader political contexts of their cities. Much of the problem with our schools lies with the reluctance of educators to recognize the profoundly political character of public education. The contributors show how urban political contexts vary widely with factors like racial composition, the role of the teachers' union, and relations between cities and surrounding metropolitan areas. Presenting case studies of original field research in Baltimore, Chicago, Houston, and six other urban areas, they consider how resistance to desegregation and the concentration of the poor in central urban areas affect education, and they suggest how cities can build support for reform through the involvement of business and other community players. By demonstrating the complex interrelationship between urban education and politics, this book shows schools to be not just places for educating children, but also major employers and large spenders of tax dollars. It also introduces the concept of civic capacity—the ability of educators and non-educators to work together on common goals—and suggests that this key issue must be addressed before education can be improved. Changing Urban Education makes it clear to educators that the outcome of reform efforts depends heavily on their political context as it reminds political scientists that education is a major part of the urban mix. While its prognosis is not entirely optimistic, it sets forth important guidelines that cannot be ignored if our schools are to successfully prepare children for the future.",N/A,N/A,358,Education,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5qcQAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=5qcQAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA186&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=410&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=5qcQAQAAMAAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&source=gbs_api

Friends Or Foes?,Norman E. Saul,N/A,2006,"With Friends or Foes? Norman Saul continues his monumental multivolume magnum opus on U.S.-Russian relations over the course of 200 years. This fourth volume provides the first comprehensive study in any language of an era that shaped the rest of the century and captures the major changes in relations between two nations on the verge of becoming dominant global powers. Among other things, Saul examines the rationale for America's failure to recognize the Soviet government through the early 1930s, analyzing the impact of the Red Scare and the roles of the State Department, Russian migrs, religious groups, and key individuals—like Charles Evans Hughes, Robert Kelley, Herbert Hoover, Boris Skvirsky, Olga Kameneva, and Maxim Litvinov—on the policy process. In addition, he recalls the American Relief Administration's gigantic effort to help Russian peasants and garners new material from American business records on concession arrangements and commerce and on Soviet responses during the first Five Year Plan. He also records travelers' impressions, cultural exchange, and the role of academia in each country—particularly the contribution of Russian émigré scholars to American education and the contributions of American journalists in Russia. Saul also reveals the tendency on both sides to preserve an atmosphere of secrecy, conducting business behind closed doors and rarely on paper. His prodigious research in the Hoover Presidential Library, the Franklin Roosevelt Library, and the Hoover Institution at Stanford University-incorporating overlooked Diplomat Post Records and featuring an interview with George Kennan on his diplomatic role—has yielded a wealth of new insights into what really happened during a period in the history of the relations between the two countries that remains mysterious and controversial. Breaking new ground in diplomatic, economic, social, and cultural history, Saul's book illuminates both the mutual fascination that briefly permitted peaceful coexistence (and eventual alliance) and the ideological battles that ultimately led to the Cold War.",N/A,N/A,464,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WbJ1AAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=WbJ1AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA21&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=417&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=WbJ1AAAAMAAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&source=gbs_api

He tells how mercantilism dominated urban thinking in territorial days until after statehood, when cities competed for the capital, prisons, universities, and other institutions. He also shows how geography and size were employed by entrepreneurs and government officials to prepare strategies for economic development. And he describes how the railroads especially promoted the founding of cities in the nineteenth century - and how this system has fared since 1950 in the face of globalization and the growth of interstate highways.""--BOOK JACKET.",N/A,N/A,504,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=A5pPAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=A5pPAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA421&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&cd=418&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=A5pPAAAAMAAJ&dq=Entrepreneurship&hl=&source=gbs_api
