The Future of Management,"Gary Hamel, Bill Breen",Harvard Business Press,2007,"What fuels long-term business success? Not operational excellence, technology breakthroughs, or new business models, but management innovation—new ways of mobilizing talent, allocating resources, and formulating strategies. Through history, management innovation has enabled companies to cross new performance thresholds and build enduring advantages. In The Future of Management, Gary Hamel argues that organizations need management innovation now more than ever. Why? The management paradigm of the last century—centered on control and efficiency—no longer suffices in a world where adaptability and creativity drive business success. To thrive in the future, companies must reinvent management. Hamel explains how to turn your company into a serial management innovator, revealing: The make-or-break challenges that will determine competitive success in an age of relentless, head-snapping change. The toxic effects of traditional management beliefs. The unconventional management practices generating breakthrough results in “modern management pioneers.” The radical principles that will need to become part of every company’s “management DNA.” The steps your company can take now to build your “management advantage.” Practical and profound, The Future of Management features examples from Google, W.L.

Science and Policy in Natural Resource Management,"Helen E. Allison, Richard J. Hobbs",Cambridge University Press,2006-08-31,"This book was first published in 2006. Despite many well-intentioned policies and changes to management practices, the world's natural resources continue to decline. The roles and interplay between science and policy in the regional broadacre agriculture landscape are examined here, offering readers a thorough understanding of the complex interactions that occur across spatial scales to produce the regional-scale impacts. The fundamental causes of resource degradation, social decline and environmental pollution are addressed, examining the cross-scale drivers from the individual farm level to the global level of commodity systems. Broadacre agriculture is a common land use throughout all continents of the world and is driven by the same type of dynamics, and this case study of the Western Australia agricultural region can be used to clearly demonstrate the principles for other agricultural systems.

Ecosystem-Based Management for the Oceans,"Karen McLeod, Heather Leslie",Island Press,2012-09-26,"Conventional management approaches cannot meet the challenges faced by ocean and coastal ecosystems today. Consequently, national and international bodies have called for a shift toward more comprehensive ecosystem-based marine management. Synthesizing a vast amount of current knowledge, Ecosystem-Based Management for the Oceans is a comprehensive guide to utilizing this promising new approach. At its core, ecosystem-based management (EBM) is about acknowledging connections. Instead of focusing on the impacts of single activities on the delivery of individual ecosystem services, EBM focuses on the array of services that we receive from marine systems, the interactive and cumulative effects of multiple human activities on these coupled ecological and social systems, and the importance of working towards common goals across sectors. Ecosystem-Based Management for the Oceans provides a conceptual framework for students and professionals who want to understand and utilize this powerful approach. And it employs case studies that draw on the experiences of EBM practitioners to demonstrate how EBM principles can be applied to real-world problems. The book emphasizes the importance of understanding the factors that contribute to social and ecological resilience —the extent to which a system can maintain its structure, function, and identity in the face of disturbance. Utilizing the resilience framework, professionals can better predict how systems will respond to a variety of disturbances, as well as to a range of management alternatives. Ecosystem-Based Management for the Oceans presents the latest science of resilience, while it provides tools for the design and implementation of responsive EBM solutions.",1610911318,9781610911313,393,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yn4mL6u35tMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=yn4mL6u35tMC&pg=PA115&dq=Management&hl=&cd=18&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yn4mL6u35tMC&source=gbs_api

Many efforts were pooled together in making this book. Three years ago, an attempt was made by one of the editors to get a project on 'Agri cultural Risk Management and Sustainabilty' (ARMAS) funded by the European Commission. Probably deeming the proposal as prematurely novel for Europe, the Commission's screening experts abandoned its evaluation. Following that experience it became apparent that the literature on the theme ought to be strengthened and emphasized through a book by a well known publishing house. The editorial team was formed relatively quickly and an invitation to known experts in the field for contributions was issued. Subsequently, Kluwer Academic Publishers, evaluated an edited volume proposal package, and final revisions were made prior to submitting the entire manuscript for publication.

Management Control of Global Supply Chains,Nils Horch,BoD – Books on Demand,2009,"Within global and rapidly changing environments, cooperation and networking offer possibilities for sharing costs and risks, as well as keeping up with constantly renewed information from outside the firms' boundaries. In line with this, an effective management control of supply chain processes seems to be relevant to compete against other supply chains and to get the required information. In this context, an implementation of a management control institution for inter-firm relations, like a supply chain management control (SCMC), that provides relevant qualitative and quantitative data to manage supply chains reflects an important issue. However, a comprehensive approach with regard to the management control of the entire supply chain and how it can be fulfilled has received scant attention in prior research. The aim of this thesis is therefore to analyze management control systems in global supply chains by means of a mixed methods design with special regard to functional, institutional and instrumental issues. In this context, qualitative data are combined with theoretical insights to develop an empirical model which is tested by means of a quantitative study.

This important new book helps answer questions typically raised by these organizations as they face diversity-related change. Why should we do this? How will we know we are being successful? What kind of change can we expect? Successful Diversity Management Initiatives presents an innovative, step-by-step model to help plan, direct, and manage strategic organizational development. This model emphasizes ongoing evaluation and clarification during each phase and propose a prototype for measuring both qualitative and quantitative results. Vignettes based on organizational experiences are used to demonstrate how particular steps in the model occur and how they hold generic value. Intended for practical application, the book is supported by case examples, summaries at the end of each chapter that include a checklist for organizational self-assessment, models, and a glossary.",0803972911,9780803972919,254,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Qvsq1kOWTHMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,5,1,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=Qvsq1kOWTHMC&pg=PA20&dq=Management&hl=&cd=23&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=Qvsq1kOWTHMC&dq=Management&hl=&source=gbs_api

"Assessing Conflict Management Practice. A case study of Aleta land polypropylene bag Factory SNNPR, Hawassa Ethiopia",Yirgalem Abera,GRIN Verlag,2017-01-12,"Bachelor Thesis from the year 2016 in the subject Art - Arts Management, grade: 3.58, Hawassa University, course: management, language: English, abstract: In order to be highly productive and being successful in any operation is somewhat a difficult task, unless conflict is managed carefully in the organization. Therefore, the main reason of conducting this research is to find out the sources of conflict, to identify conflict resolution techniques and to know the positive and negative outcomes of conflict in the organization. Among the factors that accounted for the existence of conflict in the organization, perpetual difference, value difference, modern technology and personality clashes were the most important. The effort of management to understand the existing conflict in the organization is low which implies the weakness of management of the organization in handling conflict. In general, undertaking conflict and assessing conflict management practice is important task for the reduction of problems which exist in the organization.",3668379246,9783668379244,50,Performing Arts,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LM3mDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=LM3mDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA5&dq=Management&hl=&cd=35&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=LM3mDQAAQBAJ&dq=Management&hl=&source=gbs_api

Guidelines for Evaluating the Management Information Systems of Industrial Enterprises,Edilberto L. Segura,N/A,1985,"These guidelines are intended to assist in evaluating the adequacy of the management information systems (MIS) of industrial enterprises. The introduction discusses the ojectives of a management information system and suggests how to use the guidelines. The guidelines are divided into five parts corresponding to the five functions of the enterprise: (i) finance and accounting; (ii) human resources; (iii) marketing, distribution and transportation; (iv) operations, including production, materials management and maintenance; and (v) new investments and procurement. For each of these functions, the guidelines will help evaluate the impact on the company's MIS of the business environment and management framework, as well as the adequacy of the company's systems for strategic planning, tactical planning, management control and transaction recording processes. In addition, a section is provided to help quantify the evaluation of the MIS. Furthermore, the guidelines are meant to assist in evaluating the MIS systems of its potential borrowers, but not intended to establish the Bank's requirements regarding MIS under its loans and credits. They may, however, prove of use to some enterprise managers in their own internal evaluation processes.",N/A,N/A,144,Computers,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2cU9g7eV2QkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=2cU9g7eV2QkC&q=Management&dq=Management&hl=&cd=60&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=2cU9g7eV2QkC&dq=Management&hl=&source=gbs_api

Guidance Document on the Implementation of an Incident Management System (IMS).,International Maritime Organization,N/A,2012,"This publication, prepared by the OPRC-HNS Technical Group and approved by IMO's Marine Environmental Protection Committee, provides guidance on the establishment of an incident management system (IMS) for marine pollution incidents. An established IMS provides for the safe, effective and efficient management and deployment of resources for all types of emergency incidents. It is essential for effective pollution incident management, providing a clear command structure and well-defined roles and responsibilities within an optimal span-of-control. The IMS is intended to be staffed and operated by qualified personnel from any agency and is scalable so that it can adapt organizationally based on the needs of the incident.

A Handbook of Management Theories and Models for Office Environments and Services,"Rianne Appel-Meulenbroek, Vitalija Danivska",Routledge,2021-08-02,"Although workplace design and management are gaining more and more attention from modern organizations, workplace research is still very fragmented and spread across multiple disciplines in academia. There are several books on the market related to workplaces, facility management (FM), and corporate real estate management (CREM) disciplines, but few open up a theoretical and practical discussion across multiple theories from different disciplines. Therefore, workplace researchers are not aware of all the angles from which workplace management and effects of workplace design on employees has been or could be studied. A lot of knowledge is lost between disciplines, and sadly, many insights do not reach workplace managers in practice. Therefore, this new book series is started by associate professor Rianne Appel-Meulenbroek (Eindhoven University of Technology, the Netherlands) and postdoc researcher Vitalija Danivska (Aalto University, Finland) as editors, published by Routledge. It is titled ‘Transdisciplinary Workplace Research and Management’ because it bundles important research insights from different disciplinary fields and shows its relevance for both academic workplace research and workplace management in practice. The books will address the complexity of the transdisciplinary angle necessary to solve ongoing workplace-related issues in practice, such as knowledge worker productivity, office use, and more strategic management. In addition, the editors work towards further collaboration and integration of the necessary disciplines for further development of the workplace field in research and in practice. This book series is relevant for workplace experts both in academia and industry. This second book in the series focuses on the role of workplace management in the organization and the tasks that workplace management needs to consider. The 18 theories that are presented in this book and applied to workplace research discuss management aspects from the organization’s perspective or dive deeper into issues related to people and/or building management. They all emphasize that workplace management is a complex matter that requires more strategic attention in order to add value for various stakeholders. The final chapter of the book describes a first step towards integrating the presented theories into an interdisciplinary framework for developing a grand workplace management theory.",1000434206,9781000434200,310,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dfI5EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=dfI5EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Management&hl=&cd=164&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dfI5EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Seven Metaphors on Management,F. Muna,Routledge,2017-11-01,"This title was first published in 2003. This text covers seven management metaphors that have been of great value to the author and his clients over the years in his roles as a father, manager and management trainer. Some chapters contain checklists or guidelines for action; others have short hypothetical case studies woven into the writing. These demonstrate either the principle ideas or how to use the metaphors as managerial tools. Many of the anecdotes and examples used in the book are drawn from the author's personal experience and consulting assignments in the West and the Arabian Gulf. The book is written with the practicing manager in mind. It contains many references to well-known publications but does not have an academic tone. In brief, the book summarizes up-to-date research findings and trends on a number of people management topics. It also describes the trends in management styles and practices in the Arabian Gulf over a period of 30 years, based on field research carried out in 1980, 1989 and 2002.",1351752391,9781351752398,130,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PFM8DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=PFM8DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Management&hl=&cd=194&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=PFM8DwAAQBAJ&dq=Management&hl=&source=gbs_api

Public Management and Governance,"Tony Bovaird, Elke Loeffler",Routledge,2015-09-25,"Public Management and Governance examines the factors which make government critically important and the barriers which often stop it being effective. It questions what it means to have effective policies, efficient management and good quality public services, and it explores how the process of governing could be improved. Key themes include: the challenges and pressures facing governments around the world; the changing role of the public sector in a ‘mixed economy’ of provision; governance issues such as ethics, equalities, transparency and citizen engagement. This revised and updated third edition includes eight new chapters which provide in-depth coverage of key new aspects of public management and governance. It also features a wide selection of international case studies and illuminating examples of how public policy, management and governance can be improved – and what happens when they fail. Each chapter is supplemented with discussion questions, group and individual exercises, case studies and recommendations on further reading.

Inventory Management,"Geoff Relph, Catherine Milner",Kogan Page Limited,2015,"""An organization's inventory budget is a financial amount set by the group's board members. The decisions of what inventory to have in stock, how much, where, and when, are details handled by the manager. This book, aimed at practitioners, supply chainmanagers, and operations and manufacturing professionals, provides a step-by-step approach on how to achieve the crucial link between the budget's decisions and the detail level.

Encyclopedia of Management Theory,Eric H. Kessler,"SAGE Publications, Incorporated",2013-03-28,"In discussing a management topic, scholars, educators, practitioners, and the media often toss out the name of a theorist (Taylor, Simon, Weber) or make a sideways reference to a particular theory (bureaucracy, total quality management, groupthink) and move on, as if assuming their audience possesses the necessary background to appreciate and integrate the reference. This is often far from the case. Individuals are frequently forced to seek out a hodgepodge of sources varying in quality and presentation to provide an overview of a particular idea. This work is designed to serve as a core reference for anyone interested in the essentials of contemporary management theory. Drawing together a team of international scholars, it examines the global landscape of the key theories and the theorists behind them, presenting them in the context needed to understand their strengths and weaknesses to thoughtfully apply them. In addition to interpretations of long-established theories, it also offers essays on cutting-edge research as one might find in a handbook. And, like an unabridged dictionary, it provides concise, to-the-point definitions of key concepts, ideas, schools, and figures. Features and Benefits: Two volumes containing over 280 signed entries provide users with the most authoritative and thorough reference resources available on management theory, both in terms of breadth and depth of coverage. Standardized presentation format, organized into categories based on validity and importance, structures entries so that readers can assess the fundamentals, evolution, and impact of theories. To ease navigation between and among related entries, a Reader’s Guide groups entries thematically and each entry is followed by Cross-References. In the electronic version, the Reader’s Guide combines with the Cross-References and a detailed Index to provide robust search-and-browse capabilities. An appendix with a Chronology of Management Theory allows readers to easily chart directions and trends in thought and theory from early times to the present. An appendix with Central Management Insights allows readers to easily understand, compare, and apply major theoretical messages of the field. Suggestions for Further Reading at the end of each entry guide readers to sources for more detailed research and discussion. Key themes include: Nature of Management Managing People, Personality, and Perception Managing Motivation Managing Interactions Managing Groups Managing Organizations Managing Environments Strategic Management Human Resources Management International Management and Diversity Managerial Decision Making, Ethics, and Creativity Management Education, Research, and Consulting Management of Operations, Quality, and Information Systems Management of Entrepreneurship Management of Learning and Change Management of Technology and Innovation Management and Leadership Management and Social / Environmental Issues PLUS: Appendix of Chronology of Management Theory PLUS: Appendix of Central Management Insights",1412997828,9781412997829,1056,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=94SDwAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=94SDwAEACAAJ&dq=Management&hl=&cd=203&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=94SDwAEACAAJ&dq=Management&hl=&source=gbs_api

The Triumph of Classical Management Over Lean Management: How Tradition Prevails and What to Do About It,Bob Emiliani,N/A,2018-02-04,"Since the inception of modern progressive management in the late 1800s, its creators and devoted practitioners have persistently encountered disinterest among corporate executives despite its wide-ranging benefits. The newest form of progressive management, Lean management, also suffers from executive disinterest. Why? Decades of effort to understand executive disinterest yielded no new insights - until now. Triumph of Classical Management solves a major business problem that has endured for more than 100 years. It provides a comprehensive explanation for why executives reject Lean management. It also provides practical solutions for how to gain acceptance for Lean management and an alternative.

Personal Brand Management,Talaya Waller,Springer Nature,2020-04-15,"This book is the definitive resource for understanding the phenomena and process of personal brand management as it becomes increasingly valued in a global economy. By providing a research-based, theoretical framework, the author distills the concept of personal branding as it is applicable to individuals throughout all stages of career development as well as across industries and disciplines. Extensively researched with numerous case studies, this book clearly outlines the strategic process of evaluating the economic value of a personal brand to manage and scale it accordingly. The author, an expert in the field of personal brand strategy and management, argues that a business is what a person or organization does, but the brand is what people expect from that person or organization. The two must align, and the book’s conceptual framework explains the theory and practice behind personal branding to accomplish this synergism. The consequence of the digital age is unprecedented visibility for individuals and businesses. As they engage with one another in more and more virtual spaces, the need for understanding and managing the evolving complexity of this ‘personal’ engagement is an economic reality. For this reason, the framework in this title provides insight and perspective on all phases of a brand in its recursive life cycle both on and offline. By providing clarity and structure to the topic as well as practical theory for its application, this title is the ultimate primer on personal branding in theory and practice.",3030437442,9783030437442,170,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=J1TdDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=J1TdDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Management&hl=&cd=214&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=J1TdDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

While Frederick Taylor was tinkering with the technology employed by the individual worker, Fayol was theorizing about all of the elements necessary to organize and manage a major corporation. This work, published in French in 1916, was practically ignored in the U.S. until Constance Storrs' English translation, reproduced in this edition. Since that time, Fayol's theoretical contributions have been widely recognized and his work is considered as fully important as Taylors. Fayol's work was one of the first comprehensive statements of a general theory of management. He proposed that there were Six primary functions of management and 14 principles of management: 1. Forecast and plan 2. Organize 3. Command or direct 4. Coordinate 5. Develop output 6.

Management Fashions,Krzysztof Klincewicz,N/A,2017,"""Using the theory of management fashions proposed in the 1990s by Eric Abrahamson, Krzysztof Klincewicz analyzes the changing popularity of management concepts accompanied by solutions. Among these are management bestsellers, consulting services, software systems, methodologies, and approaches to organizational change, training courses, professional certifications and even new corporate positions.The book presents the phenomena of management fashions as being the key driver for the development of the management knowledge industry, consisting of consulting companies, computer firms, publishing houses, professional institutes, and other organizations involved in the launching and the promotion of new management techniques. The author supplements the existing body of knowledge by focusing on the supply-side of management fashions, particularly the strategies and marketing techniques of solution vendors, and proposes a model of relations between management ideas and tangible solutions, explaining how bestselling ideas are turned into objects and institutions.The empirical research described in this volume involves multiple methods, including discourse volume analysis and qualitative historical techniques. Included also is a comprehensive overview of the recent relevant developments in sociology, marketing, and organization sciences, in which the author draws on the heritage of praxiology by taking a meta-level perspective on the propositions of management science.""--Provided by publisher.",020378653X,9780203786536,239,BUSINESS & ECONOMICS,en,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=_WuztAEACAAJ&dq=Management&hl=&cd=233&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=_WuztAEACAAJ&dq=Management&hl=&source=gbs_api

What may be acceptable managerial behaviour in one culture may be counterproductive or even unacceptable in another. As managers increasingly find themselves working across cultures, the need to understand these differences has become increasingly important. This book examines why these differences exist and how global managers can develop strategies and tactics to deal with them. The text draws on recent research in anthropology, psychology, and management, to explain the cultural and psychological underpinnings that shape managerial attitudes and behaviours, whilst introducing a learning model to guide in the intellectual and practical development of managers seeking enhanced global expertise.

State Management,Jan-Erik Lane,Routledge,2009-05-15,"State Management offers a comprehensive yet concise introduction to the new field of state management, presenting an analysis of basic questions within the theories of bureaucracy, policy-making, principal-agent modelling and policy networks. Focussing upon recent state transformation, it illuminates public sector reform strategies such as New Public Management as well as incorporation, tendering and bidding, decentralization, team production and privatization. This book argues that we should look upon the variety of models or approaches to public management or public administration as all belonging under ""state management"". The so-called ""working state"" in a well-ordered society involves government delivering services, paying for social security and respecting the rule of law. In this text, Jan-Erik Lane systematically examines the key approaches to the study of how government attempts to achieve these goals, discussing the pros and cons of alternative frameworks of analysis. Each chapter discusses a different issue within state management that is integral to the broader debate, including: Public regulation The relationship between the law and the state Combining ecology and policy making Multi-level governance The virtues and vices of public-private partnerships Policy implementation Presenting a clear overview of how the state operates when government sets out to deliver public services, and generating questions to encourage new research, State Management is a valuable new text for both undergraduate and postgraduate courses in political science, public administration and public management.",1134007175,9781134007172,331,Political Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rqh5AgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=rqh5AgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Management&hl=&cd=238&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rqh5AgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

This development means that more people than ever before need to understand the basic process, language and purpose of project working. That awareness is important not only for those actually engaged in project work, in all sectors of industry and commerce, but also for senior managers, project sponsors and the other stakeholders. The fourth edition of Essentials of Project Management is the junior complement to Dennis Lock's comprehensive, successful and encyclopaedic textbook, Project Management (now in its Tenth Edition). Essentials provides a concise, straightforward account of the principles and techniques of project management, designed to meet the needs of the business manager or student.

Reengineering Management,James Champy,HarperCollins Publishers,1995,"""More than two years after the publication of Reengineering the Corporation, thousands of companies large and small have undertaken the mission of reengineering, sparking a transformation in literally millions of working lives. Yet as the reengineering revolution spreads throughout the world economy, a now-familiar pattern seems to have emerged. Too often, reengineering stops at the upper echelons of corporations, and managerial levels remain unchanged or resistant to the reengineering process. As a consequence, the task of reengineering is stopped in its tracks, and the anticipated benefits are never achieved."" ""After working with dozens of companies in the throes of reengineering, Jim Champy is uniquely qualified to write the book that brings management fully into the reengineering revolution. In Reengineering Management, Champy provides the guidelines managers need to lead, organize, inspire, deploy, measure, and reward the new work reengineering creates."" ""Today's management practices hearken back to the early 1900s, when corporations changed from owner leadership to professional managers who began to run companies like controllable, predictable machines. Now that corporations have taken pains to reengineer their operational processes, the management processes must change in accordance. In Reengineering Management, Champy reveals that these processes must focus on mobilizing, enabling, defining, measuring, and communicating in order to achieve a business culture that enables a continuous process of reengineering - in order, in short, to achieve success."" ""For the hundreds of thousands of managers who have read Reengineering the Corporation and the millions who have been touched by the reengineering revolution, Reengineering Management is the book that can deliver the reality behind the promise.""--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

Practice of Project Management,"Enzo Frigenti, Dennis Comninos",Kogan Page Publishers,2005-12-03,"Traditional project management has tended to focus primarily on the processes of managing projects to successful completion. To manage projects from their inception through to actual delivery of the business-enabling objectives, a different project management approach is needed. Project management needs to become part of the business. This book addresses the concepts and issues of business project management. It aims to assist organisations in making the shift from a narrow, strong, technical focus on project management to a broader, more business-oriented focus. The Practice of Project Management introduces three basic concepts which underpin the philosophy of the business-oriented approach: Business Focused Project Management (BFPM) which takes an organisation-wide view; The Wrappers Model and Objective Directed Project Management (ODPM) both of which provide the philosophies, processes, concepts, and tools used to enable BFPM.",0749447206,9780749447205,370,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Xbw3AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=Xbw3AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Management&hl=&cd=249&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=Xbw3AAAAQBAJ&dq=Management&hl=&source=gbs_api

Administration,Herbert Strunz,"Peter Lang Gmbh, Internationaler Verlag Der Wissenschaften",1995,"In this book, «administration» is broadly interpreted as the management of organizations. The reason for this lies in the fact that administration is generally viewed in the context of public - or in an even narrower sense - state administration. However, administration is also to be found in numerous other forms - in large enterprises, to name one example. Nevertheless, neither perspective comprises the full conceptual extent of «administration» in a broader sense, and to offer proposals for solutions. Thereby, the situation in public and private organizations equally is given particular consideration. Thereby, the study of differences and common features of management in public and private administrations is of particular interest.",3631489285,9783631489284,0,Management,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=F3N3AAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=F3N3AAAACAAJ&dq=Management&hl=&cd=259&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=F3N3AAAACAAJ&dq=Management&hl=&source=gbs_api

Hospitality Management,Eli Sampson,Scientific e-Resources,2018-10-15,"Hospitality management is the study of the hospitality industry. The hospitality industry is vast and very diverse. Any time people travel, stay in a hotel, eat out, go to the movies, and engage in similar activities, they are patronizing establishments in the hospitality industry. The management of such establishments is very challenging, as managers need to be flexible enough to anticipate and meet a wide variety of needs. Hotel Management, as the term suggests, is focused on managing all aspects related to the functioning of a hotel. From the time a guest arrives at a hotel to the time he checks out, the responsibility of all activities during the guest's stay in the hotel forms part of Hotel Management. Hospitality management graduates are highly employable, applying their skills to careers in events, hotel and conference management, sales and business development and forestry and fishing management. Hospitality management means 'managing' an event, or when referring to managing a hotel, it would mean managing all the different departments and members of staff so that the paying guests feel welcomed and enjoy their stay. It is important that these people know that you are warm and friendly, so that they would probably return to the venue again in the future. This book has been developed as an attempt to provide some literature on vast growing hotel industry. This text will help immensely those who are desirous of joining the industry to equip themselves with a career in front office, housekeeping, food production, food and beverage service and tourism.",1839472812,9781839472817,342,N/A,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=R-PEDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=R-PEDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Management&hl=&cd=261&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=R-PEDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

In an era of New and post New Public Management reforms, public managers at all levels are expected to respond to these new approaches, which profoundly affect their work practices, skills, and knowledge bases. Choosing a promising strategic management model and implementing it in a way that works for the organization or inter-organizational network in question also depends on an understanding of local politico-administrative and cultural contexts: this book helps the readers identify how to successfully tailor strategic management approaches to their specific circumstances and needs.

Thoroughly updated to help public managers meet the challenges of a new decade, it has a refreshed collection of mini-cases and now includes chapter summaries. It also includes a new chapter on collaborative strategy and co-creation, in response to the growth of interest in more open forms of public policymaking.

"Management Science, Operations Research and Project Management",Jose Ramon San Cristobal Mateo,Routledge,2019-12-14,"Due to its societal and economic relevance, Project Management (PM) has become an important discipline and a concept critical to modern organizations, public and private. PM as an academic discipline is discussed both in Management Science and in Operations Research. Management Science tends to focus on quantitative tools and the soft skills necessary to manage projects successfully. Operations Research gives the essential scientific contribution to the success of project management through the development of models and algorithms. In Management Science, Operations Research and Project Management, José RamÃ3n San CristÃ3bal Mateo fills the gap between scientific research and the practical application of that research. Project managers need formal training in decision-making but sometimes, they do not have an in-depth knowledge of Operations Research or they lack the necessary theoretical background. This book, with its focus on the quantitative models of Operations Research and Management Science applied to Project Management, provides project managers with the tools and methods necessary to manage projects successfully. Project managers operate in a complex global environment, in which numerous factors need to be considered, such as minimizing total project costs, meeting contracted dates, and ensuring that activities achieve certain quality levels. The focus here on the application of quantitative models of Operations Research and Management Science applied to Project Management provides them with the tools and methods necessary to make sound decisions.",036787931X,9780367879310,234,N/A,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lV1izAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=lV1izAEACAAJ&dq=Management&hl=&cd=273&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=lV1izAEACAAJ&dq=Management&hl=&source=gbs_api

Building Efficient Management and Leadership Practices,Stefania Zanda,Springer,2017-07-18,"This book examines the relationships among leadership, the quality of the management process and business results. Drawing from the pioneering contributions of Chester I. Barnard, this book defines the role and characteristics of an effective and efficient manager in the new knowledge economy. This book also examines the relevance of Barnard’s work on modern studies in economics and business administration. Chester I. Barnard considered the company to be a complex socio-economic system, oriented towards general aims. A company’s behavior is rational if its constituent elements and management models are planned, organized, guided and regulated in order to create and maintain a cooperative system that combines efficiency and effectiveness. In this book, the conceptual construction of Barnard’s management theory is represented by a synthetic scheme in which the various components of the business process (including leadership) and their influences on the outcome variables of the company are linked as a system. This approach makes this book appealing to academics, scholars and professionals in business, management, administration and knowledge management.",3319600672,9783319600673,187,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7u_stAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=7u_stAEACAAJ&dq=Management&hl=&cd=275&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=7u_stAEACAAJ&dq=Management&hl=&source=gbs_api
A Research Agenda for Management and Organization Studies,Barbara Czarniawska,N/A,2016,"Elgar Research Agendas outline the future of research in a given area. Leading scholars are given the space to explore their subject in provocative ways, and map out the potential directions of travel. They are relevant but also visionary. Managing and organizing are now central phenomena in contemporary societies. It is essential they are studied from a variety of perspectives, and with equal attention paid to their past, their present, and their future. This book collects opinions of trailblazing scholars concerning the most important research topics, essential for study in the next 15-20 years.

The collection is intended to be inspiration for young scholars and an invitation to a dialogue with practitioners. The book's contributions are written by well-established scholars. Each is a leader in their field and will remain important figures for the next twenty years and beyond. Each chapter starts with a short summary of the present situation but focuses on the future of the discipline. The contributors cover practically all subfields of what is called business administration, or management and organization studies and include contain topics that are new, such as invisible organizations or encounters between art, popular culture and organizing.

Bosses in British Business,F. R. Jervis,Routledge,2018-04-17,"In this volume, first published in 1974, the author provides an introduction to the historical development of management in business. Success and failure in a commercial world can be explained partly in terms of economic forces, but much also depends on the people, on the management of the firms – on the bosses. The author approaches this topic by examining some of the major companies and individuals over the past two hundred years, and examines how apparently secure and profitable companies at times run into great difficulties and shows that, by examining the reasons for success and failure, pitfalls may be avoided and efficiency improved.

Foundations of Ethics in Management,Bani P. Banerjee,Excel Books India,2005,"The forces generated by an explosion in human knowledge and exponential increases in technology have brought about tectonic shifts in personal as well as corporate worldviews. And while globalisation has ushered in many benefits for companies and consumers alike, this book posits that it is the fierce competition of global market-places which drives the largely unopposed belief that firms exist solely to enhance shareholder value. The author in arguing for a wider definition of 'shareholder' is of the opinion that this is a potentially lethal fallout, because single-minded pursuit of profit for profits' sake, in yielding to the tyranny of the bottomline, has undermined traditional and long-enduring value systems, and placed ethics on the sacrificial altar of vested interests, as scams such as Enron, WorldCom and Computer Associates have amply demonstrated.To bolster his arguments, the author compels the reader to think, assess and analyse for himself as he whisks him through a whirlwind tour of western ethical and value systems beginning from the halcyon days of Plato and Aristotle, right down to modern times, running the gamut of Newton, Hobbes, Descartes, JS Mill followed by the Utilitarians, Kant, Hegel and even the Jack Welch model. He then guides the reader the labyrinth of eastern thought, including Vedic and Taoist disciplines, before citing three pragmatic Indian models with firm philosophical underpinnings, one of which he zeroes in as having the greatest potential for good governance. Written in a very lucid style, this book is sure to remain fresh in the reader's memory as long as questions of right and wrong confront him in his daily life. No book on the subject can hope to do more.",8174464360,9788174464361,200,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SX7N1By3TS0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=SX7N1By3TS0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Management&hl=&cd=293&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=SX7N1By3TS0C&dq=Management&hl=&source=gbs_api

Postmodern Management Theory,"Marta B. Calás, Linda Smircich",Routledge Revivals,2020-02-26,"First published in 1997, this volume asks: when was 'The Postmodern' in the History of Management Thought? Marta B. Calás and Linda Smircich have chosen this subtitle as entry point to the collection for several reasons. The first, and most evident, is that it prompts us to reflect on the inclusion of a volume on postmodern organization studies within a series of books on the history of management thought. What does such inclusion signal? Are we saying that we are past the postmodern in organization studies? That we have transcended modernity and, beyond, postmodernity? Similar to other social sciences, organization and management studies in the Anglo-American and European academy became impressed by the styles of 'postmodernism' and their epistemological companions, 'poststructuralisms', during the 1980s. For this collection we have selected twenty two journal articles, published between 1985 and 1996, that we consider emblematic of postmodern endeavours in management thought, as they further our understanding of how 'truth' (of any paradigmatic persuasion), is fashioned through particular discourses and other signifying practices. Taken together, these articles address the following questions: What has the field accomplished through attempts at being postmodern? With what consequences? And, where does the field stand now, if it is still/already (going) after 'the postmodern'? In our view 'the postmodern' cannot transcend modern management thought; it is, rather, part of it. Nevertheless, the mere appearance of efforts towards making the field 'postmodern' makes it important to account for them in the history of the field. Such is the narrative that we are trying to portray in this volume.",1138363316,9781138363311,542,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_wftygEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=_wftygEACAAJ&dq=Management&hl=&cd=306&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=_wftygEACAAJ&dq=Management&hl=&source=gbs_api
Governance and Public Management,"Charles Conteh, Thomas J. Greitens, David K. Jesuit, Ian Roberge",Routledge,2014-05-09,"The key difference between success and failure for most governance systems is adaptation, specifically the ability to resolve the existing social, cultural, economic and environmental challenges that constrain adaptation. Local, regional and national systems differ in how they are designed to organize effective participation and create innovative ideas for missions, goals, strategies and actions. They also differ in how they build the effective coalitions needed to adopt, guide and protect strategies and actions during implementation, and how to build competence and knowledge to sustain implementation. This book presents the strategic foundations for government’s role in fostering and adapting to societal transformation in a volatile world. It shifts the focus of the discipline from an overtly retrospective analysis to a prospective analysis, incorporating the role of foresight techniques and instruments. Above all, it stimulates debate about the practical implications of governance as an emergent future-oriented framework of public management.

Project Management,"Clifford F. Gray, Erik W. Larson",McGraw Hill Professional,2002-10,"Not long ago project management was perceived as a highly technical endeavor with applications to highly specialized industries. Times have changed-and so have the collective perceptions about project management. Today project management skills are applied throughout a wide range of businesses and industries. Successful project managers are defined now not only by their skill in dealing with issues of planning, scheduling, and budgeting, but also by their ability to manage people. Clifford Gray and Erik Larson, both of Oregon State University, are aware of this evolution and have used the Third Edition of Project Management: The Managerial Process to address these shifts. This highly-qualified author team provides readers with a complete picture of project management. Technical issues are addressed thoroughly, but unlike similar books on this subject, Project Management: The Managerial Process presents them in context, demonstrating how project management techniques can be applied in a wide variety of businesses, while emphasizing the importance of accounting for the human element in the successful management of all types of projects. Case studies and ""Snapshot from Practice"" boxes are among the ways readers learn throughout this text. A pedagogically rich CD-ROM, and a second CD-ROM containing a trial version of Microsoft Project, are also available with all new copies of this text.

Price Management,"Hermann Simon, Martin Fassnacht",Springer,2019-03-08,"In this book, the world’s foremost experts on pricing integrate theoretical rigor and practical application to present a comprehensive resource that covers all areas of the field. This volume brings together quantitative and qualitative approaches and highlights the most current innovations in theory and practice. Going beyond the traditional constraints of “price theory” and “price policy,” the authors coined the term “price management” to represent a holistic approach to pricing strategy and tactical implementation. They remind us that the Ancient Romans used one word, pretium, to mean both price and value. This is the fundamental philosophy that drives successful price management where producer and customer meet. Featuring dozens of examples and case studies drawn from their extensive research, consulting, and teaching around the world, Simon and Fassnacht cover all aspects of pricing following the price management process with its four phases: strategy, analysis, decision, and implementation. Thereby, the authors take into account the nuances across industry sectors, including consumer goods, industrial products, services, and trade/distribution. In particular, they address the implications of technological advancements, such as the Internet and new measurement and sensor technologies that have led to a wealth of price management innovations, such as flat rates, freemium, pay-per-use, or pay-what-you-want. They also address the emergence of new price metrics, Big Data applications, two-sided price systems, negative prices, and the sharing economy, as well as emerging payment systems such as bitcoin. The result is a “bible” for leaders who recognize that price is not only a means to drive profit in the short term, but a tool to generate sustained growth in shareholder value over the longer term, and a primer for researchers, instructors, and students alike.

Art of Modern Oriental Management,Sing Ong Yu,Ws Professional,2017,"This book aims to present an overview of Chinese, Japanese and Korean modern management styles. The cultures of China, Japan and Korea are influenced by Confucianism, Daoism and Buddhism. As such, there are some basic similarities in their management styles. As business operations become more internationalised, the management styles among Chinese, Japanese and Korean companies have blurred the lines of distinction between Western and Eastern cultures. The need for Western managers to adapt to Asian way of doing business, and likewise for Asian companies to understand Western business practices, means that managers have to bridge the gaps and adopt the best management practices containing both Western and Eastern elements. Unlike the traditional approach of setting clear differentiation between Western and Eastern cultures, this book looks at Oriental management from a modern perspective, that is, the fusion of Western and Eastern management styles. By using a multifaceted approach to understanding modern Oriental management, the author stresses the complexities of the business environment in China, Japan and Korea. He suggests that Western theories of management are applicable to Eastern cultural context with some adaptations to the local environment. The author also offers valuable insights into the management styles of Oriental managers by providing a critical perspective of their thought processes in simple yet highly relevant illustrations of models and frameworks.

Innovation Project Management,Harold Kerzner,John Wiley & Sons,2019-09-04,"Actionable tools, processes and metrics for successfully managing innovation projects Conventional project management methods are oftentimes insufficient for managing innovation projects. Innovation is lost under the pre-determined scope and forecasted environments of traditional project management. There is tremendous pressure on organizations to innovate, and the project managers responsible for managing these innovation projects do not have the training or tools to do their jobs effectively. Innovation Project Management provides the tools, insights, and metrics needed to successfully manage innovation projects—helping readers identify problems in their organization, conceive elegant solutions, and, when necessary, promote changes to their organizational culture. There are several kinds of innovation—ranging from incremental changes to existing products to wholly original processes that emerge from market-disrupting new technology—that possess different characteristics and often require different tools. Best-selling author and project management expert Harold Kerzner integrates innovation, project management, and strategic planning to offer students and practicing professionals the essential tools and processes to analyze innovation from all sides. Innovation Project Management deconstructs traditional project management methods and explains why and how innovation projects should be managed differently. This invaluable resource: Provides practical advice and actionable tools for effectively managing innovation projects Offers value-based project management metrics and guidance on how to establish a metrics management program Shares exclusive insights from project managers at world-class organizations such as Airbus, Boeing, Hitachi, IBM, and Siemens on how they manage innovation projects Explores a variety of types of innovation including co-creation, value-driven, agile, open versus closed, and more Instructors have access to PowerPoint lecture slides by chapter through the book’s companion website Innovation Project Management: Methods, Case Studies, and Tools for Managing Innovation Projects is an essential text for professional project managers, corporate managers, innovation team members, as well as students in project management, innovation and entrepreneurship programs.",1119587298,9781119587293,578,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bUefDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=bUefDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Management&hl=&cd=349&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=bUefDwAAQBAJ&dq=Management&hl=&source=gbs_api

Enterprise Risk Management,Stefan Hunziker,Springer Gabler,2021-05-19,"This textbook demonstrates how Enterprise Risk Management creates value in strategic- and decision-making-processes. The author introduces modern approaches to balancing risk and reward based on many examples of medium-sized and large companies from different industries. Since traditional risk management in practice is often an independent stand-alone process with no impact on decision-making processes, it is unable to create value and ties up resources in the company unnecessarily. Herewith, he serves students as well as practitioners with modern approaches that promote a connection between ERM and corporate management. The author demonstrates in a didactically appropriate manner how companies can use ERM in a concrete way to achieve better risk-reward decisions under uncertainty. Furthermore, theoretical and psychological findings relevant to entrepreneurial decision-making situations are incorporated.

Islamic Values and Management Practices,Maqbouleh M Hammoudeh,"Gower Publishing, Ltd.",2012-08-28,"The author of this thought provoking addition to Gower's Transformation and Innovation Series has worked as a management consultant in the Arab Middle East for 25 years. In Islamic Values and Management Practices she acknowledges that businesses and other organizations in the region face urgent concerns in relation to quality and transformation, but argues that these issues might be more appropriately addressed by the application of an Islamic Management Model, rather than the 'Western' one hitherto applied. Over time, a set of management systems based on Islamic values has been developed by the author. These systems recognise the need to build human organizations, socially and politically as well as commercially, and also the recognition that for Muslims, justice is the ultimate value, bringing balance between the individual's soul and spirit on the one hand, and the organization's soul and spirit on the other. This Islamic management model stresses that effectiveness is an outcome of operating efficiently and at the same time unifying the organization's objectives with those of its employees and wider society, and ensuring that at the strategic level the long view is always maintained. Recounting her own personal and business journey, Maqbouleh Hammoudeh presents the outcomes of research that has tested the application of the Islamic Management Model and its ability to deliver the desired quality and transformation outcomes in a major civic or profit making organization. At a time when many practitioners and business educators are seeking new management approaches, this revealing case study sheds light on the evolution of a contemporary theory of management for the Muslim World.",1409460215,9781409460213,195,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=y_7wNz07FeEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=y_7wNz07FeEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Management&hl=&cd=381&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=y_7wNz07FeEC&dq=Management&hl=&source=gbs_api

Energy Management in Business,Kit Oung,"Gower Publishing, Ltd.",2013-02-28,"The business benefits of lower energy consumption are clear: lower energy costs, energy tax avoidance, selling excess CO2 credits, immediately adding savings to the bottom line and improved competitiveness. However, with a need to focus on day to day business management activities, implementing energy reduction programmes stretches the capabilities and know-how of responsible managers. Kit Oung’s Energy Management in Business is an expert's guide to energy reduction. It covers four important aspects of managing energy: strategy for successful implementation, available tools and techniques, generating sustainable quick wins and active management involvement. This book offers distilled practical concepts with real life case studies chosen to build insight, and illustrate how managers and engineers can relate to a broad range of energy reduction opportunities. We take energy for granted, like the air we breathe. We need to engage employees with energy management in two ways. In a more general sense, for those using energy for normal working practices, awareness and behaviour change are key. For those with more direct influence over energy using systems, engagement is also fundamental. Energy Management in Business places the process firmly in the context of commercial and industrial business practice. The book is an excellent companion for any organisation seeking ISO 50001 certification and a reduced energy consumption, as well as those that simply wish to better understand the options, strategies and risks that every business now faces.",1472402456,9781472402455,452,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EfRbgG0-xW0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=EfRbgG0-xW0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Management&hl=&cd=383&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=EfRbgG0-xW0C&dq=Management&hl=&source=gbs_api

Outcome-Based Performance Management in the Public Sector,"Elio Borgonovi, Eugenio Anessi-Pessina, Carmine Bianchi",Springer,2018-08-07,"This book highlights the use of an outcome-oriented view of performance to frame and assess the desirability of the effects produced by adopted policies, so to allow governments not only to consider effects in the short, but also the long run. Furthermore, it does not only focus on policy from the perspective of a single unit or institution, but also under an inter-institutional viewpoint. This book features theoretical and empirical research on how public organizations have evolved their performance management systems toward outcome measures that may allow one to better deal with wicked problems. Today, ‘wicked problems’ characterize most of governmental planning involving social issues. These are complex policy problems, underlying high risk and uncertainty, and a high interdependency among variables affecting them. Such problems cannot be clustered within the boundaries of a single organization, or referred to specific administrative levels or ministries. They are characterized by dynamic complexity, involving multi-level, multi-actor and multi-sectoral challenges. In the last decade, a number of countries have started to develop new approaches that may enable to improve cohesion, to effectively deal with wicked problems. The chapters in this book showcase these approaches, which encourage the adoption of more flexible and pervasive governmental systems to overcome such complex problems. Outcome-Based Performance Management in the Public Sector is divided into five parts. Part 1 aims at shedding light on problems and issues implied in the design and implementation of “outcome-based” performance management systems in the public sector. Then Part 2 illustrates the experiences, problems, and evolving trends in three different countries (Scotland, USA, and Italy) towards the adoption of outcome-based performance management systems in the public sector. Such analyses are conducted at both the national and local government levels. The third part of the book frames how outcome-based performance management can enhance public governance and inter-institutional coordination. Part 4 deals with the illustration of challenges and results from different public sector domains. Finally the book concludes in Part 5 as it examines innovative methods and tools that may support decision makers in dealing with the challenges of outcome-based performance management in the public sector. Though the book is specifically focused on a research target, it will also be useful to practitioners and master students in public administration .",3319860585,9783319860589,0,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xyDmwQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=xyDmwQEACAAJ&dq=Management&hl=&cd=386&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=xyDmwQEACAAJ&dq=Management&hl=&source=gbs_api

Key Account Management,"Joel Le Bon, Carl Herman",Business Expert Press,2015-05-07,"Now more than ever, companies are faced with a critical and challenging truth. Today’s customer is demanding more attention, superior service, and the expertise of a dedicated sales team. Suppliers must make dif cult choices to determine how to allocate limited resources, including which customers receive the highest level of service. Increasingly, supply side organizations are working to design and implement key account programs to meet or exceed these expectations. Key account management is a specific business strategy that involves complex sales processes, large-scale negotiations, and the alignment of multiple internal and external stakeholders. This multi-pronged process is anything but straightforward, and the business world is filled with examples of key account programs that have not achieved the expected results. This book addresses the strategic challenges facing top executives and sales leaders as they build strategies to better manage their key accounts. By leveraging up-to-date research, testimonials drawn from interviews with experienced practitioners, best practices of successful companies, along with straightforward practical guide- lines for executives and sales leaders, this book can serve as an instruction manual and toolbox for organizations working to achieve success through their key account strategies to meet the demand of their key customers.",1631571753,9781631571756,181,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6Tf_CAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=6Tf_CAAAQBAJ&dq=Management&hl=&cd=388&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=6Tf_CAAAQBAJ&dq=Management&hl=&source=gbs_api

Construction Project Management,"Peter Fewings, Christian Henjewele",Routledge,2019-03-21,"Construction Project Management: An Integrated Approach is a management approach to leading projects and the effective choice and use of project management tools and techniques. It seeks to push the boundaries of project management to take on board future needs and user issues. Integration of the construction project, meaning closer relations between the project team, the supply chain and the client, is long overdue; however, despite some signs of growth in this area, the industry nonetheless remains fragmented in its approach. The role of the project manager is to integrate diverse interests and unify objectives to achieve a common goal. This has now broadened to include a responsibility, on the parts of both client and team, to ensure that construction addresses current and future societal needs. From an economic perspective, a great deal of waste is connected with conflict, thus a holistic approach that increases the efficiency and effectiveness of the task at hand will inject energy into project management. This third edition now takes on board the impact of technology in building information modelling and other digitised technologies such as artificial intelligence. Together, they open up avenues for more direct and incisive action to test creative design, manufacture directly and communicate spontaneously and intuitively. In time, such technologies will change the role of project managers but will never take away their responsibility to be passionate about construction and to integrate the team. A new chapter has been added that considers future societal needs. This edition is also reordered to make the project life cycle and process chapters clearer. This book combines best practice in construction with the theories underpinning project management and presents a wealth of practical case studies – many new. It focuses on all construction disciplines that may manage projects. The book is of unique value to students in the later years of undergraduate courses and those on specialist postgraduate courses in project management and also for practitioners in all disciplines and clients who have experienced the frustration caused by the fragmentation of construction projects.",1351122010,9781351122016,580,Technology & Engineering,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=my6ODwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=my6ODwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Management&hl=&cd=409&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=my6ODwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

While global corporate travel risks are increasing exponentially, many security and business managers are not well-versed in the rapidly changing global landscape of travel risk, nor do they fully realize the multitude of risks their companies face if they don't comply with their legal obligations—""duty of care""—for protecting their employees from foreseeable harm, which can cost a company in the form of extensive fines, productivity loss, business interruptions, stock price loss, litigation, and even potential bankruptcy.

It serves as a reference point for working with other departments, including human resources and legal, paving the way for better internal cooperation for travel managers and security managers.
