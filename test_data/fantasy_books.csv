Fantasy Literature,Mark A. Fabrizi,Springer,2016-10-11,"Fantasy literature, often derided as superficial and escapist, is one of the most popular and enduring genres of fiction worldwide. It is also—perhaps surprisingly—thought-provoking, structurally complex, and relevant to contemporary society, as the essays in this volume attest. The scholars, teachers, and authors represented here offer their perspectives on this engaging genre. Within these pages, a reader will find a wealth of ideas to help teachers use these texts in the classroom, challenging students to read fantasy with a critical eye. They employ interdisciplinary, philosophical, and religious lenses, as well as Marxist and feminist critical theory, to help students unlock texts. The books discussed include epic fantasy by such authors as Tolkien and Le Guin, children’s fantasy by Beatrix Potter and Saint-Exupéry, modern fantasy by Rowling and Martin, and even fairy tales and comic books. The contributors offer provocations, questioning the texts and pushing the boundaries of meaning within the fantasy genre. And in doing so, they challenge readers themselves to ponder these tales more deeply. But through each of these chapters runs a profound love of the genre and a respect for those who produce such beautiful and moving stories. Furthermore, as with all the books in this series, this volume is informed by the tenets of critical pedagogy, and is focused on re-envisioning fantasy literature through the lens of social justice and empowerment.

In a sweeping analysis from the sophists Aristotle, and Cicero through Kenneth Burke, Chaïm Perelman and Lucie Olbrechts-Tyceta, and contemporary scholars in English, communication, and rhetoric’s other disciplinary homes, Allen offers a novel definition of rhetorical theory: as the self-consciously ethical study of how humans and other symbolic animals negotiate constraints.",0822983427,9780822983422,289,Language Arts & Disciplines,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5fpjDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=5fpjDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA214&dq=fantasy&hl=&cd=14&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=5fpjDwAAQBAJ&dq=fantasy&hl=&source=gbs_api
Teaching Fantasy Writing,Carl Anderson,Corwin Press,2024-07-19,"Teaching fantasy writing increases student engagement, enables them to flex their creative muscles – and helps them learn important narrative writing skills. Opportunities for kids to lean into their innate creativity and imagination have been squeezed out of most school days, due to the pressures of standardized testing. And writing instruction has become more and more formulaic. In Teaching Fantasy Writing, Carl Anderson shows you how to include a study of fantasy writing in your writing curriculum that will engage student interest and creativity -- and make writing exciting for them again. Teaching Fantasy Writing is a game-changer. The fantasy genre gives children tools for expression that other genres don’t, providing them with a powerful way to work through challenging issues and emotions. And it also offers students the opportunity to address subjects such as gaining confidence in oneself, bullying, fighting injustice – and more. Plus, fantasy writing helps kids learn the skills necessary to meet narrative writing standards. And they’ll have fun doing it! If you’re an elementary school teacher who wants to help your students develop their writing skills by studying a high-interest, high-impact genre, you’ve come to the right place. In Teaching Fantasy Writing, Carl Anderson will: Discuss why fantasy writing develops students’ creativity, increases their engagement in writing, and accelerates their growth as writers Walk you through fantasy units for students in grades K-1, 2-3, and 4-6, which include detailed lessons you can teach to help students write beautiful and powerful fantasy stories Suggest mentor texts that will show students how to craft their fantasy stories. Show you examples of students’ fantasy writing, including the ""worldbuilding"" work they do before writing drafts Explain how you can modify the units and lessons to fit the needs of the students in your classroom By teaching fantasy writing, you can reignite the spark of creativity in your students and increase their joy in writing.

Race and Popular Fantasy Literature,Helen Young,Routledge,2015-08-11,"This book illuminates the racialized nature of twenty-first century Western popular culture by exploring how discourses of race circulate in the Fantasy genre. It examines not only major texts in the genre, but also the impact of franchises, industry, editorial and authorial practices, and fan engagements on race and representation. Approaching Fantasy as a significant element of popular culture, it visits the struggles over race, racism, and white privilege that are enacted within creative works across media and the communities which revolve around them. While scholars of Science Fiction have explored the genre’s racialized constructs of possible futures, this book is the first examination of Fantasy to take up the topic of race in depth. The book’s interdisciplinary approach, drawing on Literary, Cultural, Fan, and Whiteness Studies, offers a cultural history of the anxieties which haunt Western popular culture in a century eager to declare itself post-race. The beginnings of the Fantasy genre’s habits of whiteness in the twentieth century are examined, with an exploration of the continuing impact of older problematic works through franchising, adaptation, and imitation. Young also discusses the major twenty-first century sub-genres which both re-use and subvert Fantasy conventions. The final chapter explores debates and anti-racist praxis in authorial and fan communities. With its multi-pronged approach and innovative methodology, this book is an important and original contribution to studies of race, Fantasy, and twenty-first century popular culture.",1317532171,9781317532170,239,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FvlWCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=FvlWCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA35&dq=fantasy&hl=&cd=19&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=FvlWCgAAQBAJ&dq=fantasy&hl=&source=gbs_api

Fantasy Literature and Christianity,Weronika Łaszkiewicz,McFarland,2018-10-04,"The debate surrounding the Christian aspects of C.S. Lewis's The Chronicles of Narnia, J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials and J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter has revealed not only the prominence of religious themes in fantasy fiction, but also readers' concerns over portrayals of religion in fantasy. Yet while analyses of these works fill many volumes, other fantasy series have received much less attention. This critical study explores the fantastic religions and religious themes in American and Canadian works by Stephen R. Donaldson (Chronicles of Thomas Covenant), Guy Gavriel Kay (Fionavar Tapestry), Celia S. Friedman (Coldfire Trilogy), and Brandon Sanderson (Mistborn). References to biblical tradition and Christian teachings reveal these writers' overall approach to Christianity and the relationship between Christianity and the fantasy genre.",1476634831,9781476634838,224,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tuxzDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=tuxzDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA206&dq=fantasy&hl=&cd=25&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tuxzDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Gender and Sexuality in Contemporary Popular Fantasy,"Jude Roberts, Esther MacCallum-Stewart",Routledge,2016-06-03,"This book explores the ways in which contemporary writers, artists, directors, producers and fans use the opportunities offered by popular fantasy to exceed or challenge norms of gender and sexuality, focusing on a range of media, including television episodes and series, films, video games and multi-player online role-play games, novels and short stories, comics, manga and graphic novels, and board games. Engaging directly with an enormously successful popular genre which is often overlooked by literary and cultural criticism, contributors pay close attention to the ways in which the producers of fantasy texts, whether visual, game, cinematic, graphic or literary texts, are able to play with gender and sexuality, to challenge and disrupt received notions and to allow and encourage their audiences to imagine ways of being outside of the constitutive constraints of socialized gender and sexual identity. With rich case studies from the US, Australia, UK, Japan and Europe, all concentrating not on the critique of fantasy texts which duplicate or reinforce existing prejudices about gender and sexuality, but on examining the exploration of or attempt to make possible non-normative gendered and sexual identities, this volume will appeal to scholars across the social sciences and humanities, with interests in popular culture, fantasy, media studies and gender and sexualities.",1317130545,9781317130543,203,Social Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2MNJDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=2MNJDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA8&dq=fantasy&hl=&cd=28&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=2MNJDAAAQBAJ&dq=fantasy&hl=&source=gbs_api

Interface Fantasy,Andre Nusselder,MIT Press,2009-09-11,"Behind our computer screens we are all cyborgs: through fantasy we can understand our involvement in virtual worlds. Cyberspace is first and foremost a mental space. Therefore we need to take a psychological approach to understand our experiences in it. In Interface Fantasy, André Nusselder uses the core psychoanalytic notion of fantasy to examine our relationship to computers and digital technology. Lacanian psychoanalysis considers fantasy to be an indispensable “screen” for our interaction with the outside world; Nusselder argues that, at the mental level, computer screens and other human-computer interfaces incorporate this function of fantasy: they mediate the real and the virtual. Interface Fantasy illuminates our attachment to new media: why we love our devices; why we are fascinated by the images on their screens; and how it is possible that virtual images can provide physical pleasure. Nusselder puts such phenomena as avatars, role playing, cybersex, computer psychotherapy, and Internet addiction in the context of established psychoanalytic theory. The virtual identities we assume in virtual worlds, exemplified best by avatars consisting of both realistic and symbolic self-representations, illustrate the three orders that Lacan uses to analyze human reality: the imaginary, the symbolic, and the real. Nusselder analyzes our most intimate involvement with information technology—the almost invisible, affective aspects of technology that have the greatest impact on our lives. Interface Fantasy lays the foundation for a new way of thinking that acknowledges the pivotal role of the screen in the current world of information. And it gives an intelligible overview of basic Lacanian principles (including fantasy, language, the virtual, the real, embodiment, and enjoyment) that shows their enormous relevance for understanding the current state of media technology.",0262266490,9780262266499,185,Philosophy,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hyfM4R8zbtkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=hyfM4R8zbtkC&pg=PA3&dq=fantasy&hl=&cd=46&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hyfM4R8zbtkC&source=gbs_api

Victorian Fantasy,Stephen Prickett,Baylor University Press,2005,"Far from being just children's literature, Victorian Fantasy is an art form that flourished in opposition to the repressive social and intellectual conditions of Victorianism. In this fully revised and expanded edition, Stephen Prickett explores the way in which Victorian writers used non-realistic techniques--nonsense, dreams, visions, and the creation of other worlds--to extend our understanding of this world. In particular, Prickett focuses on six writers (Lear, Carroll, Kingsley, MacDonald, Kipling, and Nesbit), tracing the development of their art form, their influences on each other, and how these writers used fantasy to question the ideology of Victorian culture and society.",1932792309,9781932792300,308,English literature,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OZR3xMKa7_AC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=OZR3xMKa7_AC&pg=PA11&dq=fantasy&hl=&cd=50&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=OZR3xMKa7_AC&dq=fantasy&hl=&source=gbs_api

Fantasy Island,"Larry Elliott, Dan Atkinson",Constable & Robinson,2007,"We live in a country fantasising about its ability to run up debts seemingly without end, to enjoy high-paid employment for which it is not qualified, to project military power that it does not possess and in general to assume, in defiance of the evidence, a superior economic and political position in relation to most of the rest of the world. Then there is the apparent conviction that limitless growth can co-exist with environmental protection, that the over-borrowed and abundantly staffed state machine is actually being courageously pruned even while its payroll rises and, finally, that the just-around-the-corner radiant future is one in which will work in the 'creative economy'. Welcome to Fantasy Island. He may be the most spectacular election winner in modern British political history but Blair leaves behind him a seedy dreamworld mired in debt and bankruptcy, drifting into a crisis of employment and employability, hallucinating into existence a diplomatic and military role that it cannot possibly afford.

Performing Fantasy and Reality in Contemporary Culture,Anastasia Seregina,Routledge,2018-09-03,"We frequently engage with that which we consciously perceive not to be real, yet fantasy, despite its pervasive presence and strong role in everyday life through its connection to identities, communities, desires, and meanings, has yet to be properly defined and researched. This book examines fantasy from a performance theory perspective. Drawing on multidisciplinary literature, it presents ethnographic and art-based research on live action role-playing games to explore fantasy as a bodily and negotiated phenomenon that involves various kinds of engagement with one’s surroundings. Overall, this book is a study of various forms and roles that fantasy can take on as part of contemporary Western culture. The study suggests that fantasy emerges as a different type of interpretation of normalised performance and reality, and can thus provide individuals with the tools to wield agency in everyday life. The book will appeal to scholars of sociology, cultural and media studies, literature and performance studies.",1351613383,9781351613385,360,Social Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MJFoDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=MJFoDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=fantasy&hl=&cd=145&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MJFoDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Modern Fantasy,Colin N. Manlove,Wipf and Stock Publishers,2020-04-16,"After a decade from 1965 which had seen the growth in Britain and America of an enormous interest in fantasy literature, and a rise in its academic repute from cold to lukewarm, a serious study of the subject seemed long overdue. In this first critical book in its time on modern English fantasy, Colin Manlove surveys a representative group of modern fantasies--in the Victorian period in the children's scientific and Christian fantasy The Water-Babies by Charles Kingsley and the mystical fantasy of the Scottish writer George MacDonald; and from the twentieth century the interplanetary romances of C. S. Lewis, the post-war fantasy of rebellious youth in Mervyn Peake's Gormenghast books, and the quest to avert apocalypse in J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. The aim with all these works is to show the peculiar literary experiences they offer and to assess their strengths and limitations in relation to wider English literature. In the introduction to his book, Manlove gives a definition of fantasy, marking off the genre from its near neighbors science fiction and ""Gothic"" or horror story, and distinguishing between fantasies that are serious works of imagination and those that are fanciful or escapist. Each chapter that follows is primarily a literary analysis set in a context of the writer's life, thought, and other works. As the book proceeds, there begins to emerge a picture of the originality and merit of the writers, but at the same time the sense of a division in the purpose of each writer, whereby their works fail to abide by their own laws. In the conclusion to this book Manlove draws the different types of division found into one and argues that the problem is one that is endemic to the writing of modern fantasy.",153269184X,9781532691843,320,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dVf7DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=dVf7DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=fantasy&hl=&cd=161&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dVf7DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

The Classic Fantasy Collection,"Robert E. Howard, H. P. Lovecraft, G. G. Pendarves, H. G. Wells, William Morris, Lafcadio Hearn, Abraham Merritt, Arthur Machen, Ernest Bramah, Robert W. Chambers, George MacDonald",Arcturus Publishing,2017-07-31,"Epic romances, fearsome dragons and alien worlds lie between the pages of this volume. Containing more than 35 stories from the early masters of fantasy literature, the narratives here transport the reader to alternate worlds where magic abounds, cosmic terrors lie around the corner and intrepid heroes fight for justice. Drawing inspiration from Norse, Japanese and Chinese mythology as well as from traditional fairytales and modern fears, the authors collected here span the breadth of the genre. Including tales from William Morris, H. G. Wells, Robert E. Howard and H. P. Lovecraft amongst others, they demonstrate the plethora of imaginative literature that was written in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Many of these tales were foundational works, bringing ideas of the supernatural into the mainstream, and through their efforts creating entirely new genres. Before Tolkien, there were many writers embracing the realm of fantastic fiction. The man responsible for its origin was George MacDonald (1824-1905), a Calvinist minister and Celtic scholar, who wrote the first true fantasy novel. He was followed by a number of imaginative successors at the end of the 19th century, including H. G. Wells, Arthur Machen, and Ernest Bramah. After the end of World War I, the pulp magazines opened up the genre to a new generation of writers - particularly H. P. Lovecraft and Robert E. Howard - who provided exciting, magical and horrifying tales that fascinated a multitude of readers. By the outbreak of World War II, the outlines of the fantasy genre had been sketched out by these pioneers, and an entirely new type of fiction had been created. This collection includes stories by: Robert E. Howard H. P. Lovecraft G. G. Pendarves H. G. Wells William Morris Lafcadio Hearn Abraham Merritt Arthur Machen Ernest Bramah Robert W.

Tolkien created modern fantasy with The Lord of the Rings, set in a fictional world based upon his life in the early 20th century British Empire, and his love of language and medieval literature. In small-town Texas, Robert E. Howard pounded out his own fantasy realm in his Conan stories, published serially in the ephemeral pulp magazines he loved. Jerry Siegel created Superman with Joe Shuster, and laid the foundation for perhaps the most far-reaching fantasy worlds: the universe of DC and Marvel comics.

R. Martin, and Anne McCaffrey Legends II picks up where its illustrious predecessor left off. All of the bestselling writers represented in Legends II return to the special universe of the imagination that its author has made famous throughout the world.

ROBERT SILVERBERG spins an enthralling tale of Majipoor’s early history—and remote future—as seen through the eyes of a dilettantish poet who discovers an unexpected destiny in “The Book of Changes.” TAD WILLIAMS explores the strange afterlife of Orlando Gardiner, from his Otherland saga, in “The Happiest Dead Boy in the World.” ANNE McCAFFREY shines a light into the most mysterious and wondrous of all places on Pern in the heartwarming “Beyond Between.” RAYMOND E. FEIST turns from the great battles of the Riftwar to the story of one soldier, a young man about to embark on the ride of his life, in “The Messenger.” ELIZABETH HAYDON tells of the destruction of Serendair and the fate of its last defenders in “Threshold,” set at the end of the Third Age of her Symphony of Ages series. NEIL GAIMAN gives us a glimpse into what befalls the man called Shadow after the events of his Hugo Award–winning novel American Gods in “The Monarch of the Glen.” TERRY BROOKS adds an exciting epilogue to The Wishsong of Shannara in “Indomitable,” the tale of Jair Ohmsford’s desperate quest to complete the destruction of the evil Ildatch . . . armed only with the magic of illusion.",0345471091,9780345471093,683,Fiction,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aCG7Xo0PjN0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,2.5,3,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=aCG7Xo0PjN0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=fantasy&hl=&cd=186&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aCG7Xo0PjN0C&source=gbs_api

Their ubiquity represents a major shift in human experience, and although we often hold our devices dear, we do not always fully appreciate how their nearly constant presence can influence our lives for better and for worse. In this revised and expanded edition of How Fantasy Becomes Reality, social psychologist Karen E. Dill-Shackleford explains what the latest science tells us about how our devices influence our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. In engaging, conversational prose, she discusses both the benefits and the risks that come with our current level of media saturation. The wide-ranging conversation explores Avatar, Mad Men, Grand Theft Auto, and Comic Con to address critical issues such as media violence, portrayals of social groups, political coverage, and fandom. Her conclusions will empower readers to make our favorite sources of entertainment and information work for us and not against us.",019023931X,9780190239312,281,Psychology,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dRKnCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=dRKnCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=fantasy&hl=&cd=188&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dRKnCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Strictly Fantasy,Gerald Nachtwey,McFarland,2021-05-07,"Role-playing games seemed to appear of nowhere in the early 1970s and have been a quiet but steady presence in American culture ever since. This new look at the hobby searches for the historical origins of role-playing games deep in the imaginative worlds of Western culture. It looks at the earliest fantasy stories from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, at the fans--both readers and writers--who wanted to bring them to life, at the Midwestern landscape and the middle-class households that were the hobby's birthplace, and at the struggle to find meaning and identity amidst cultural conflicts that drove many people into these communities of play. This book also addresses race, religion, gender, fandom, and the place these games have within American capitalism. All the paths of this journey are connected by the very quality that has made fantasy role-playing so powerful: it binds the limitless imagination into a ""strict"" framework of rules. Far from being an accidental offshoot of marginalized fan communities, role-playing games' ability to hold contradictions in dynamic, creative tension made them a necessary and central product of the twentieth century.",1476675716,9781476675718,200,Games & Activities,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aoMwEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=aoMwEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=fantasy&hl=&cd=191&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=aoMwEAAAQBAJ&dq=fantasy&hl=&source=gbs_api

Fantasy and Myth in the Anthropocene,"Tereza Déedinovâa, Marek Oziewicz, Brian Attebery",N/A,2022,"""The first study to look at the intersection of the discourse of the Anthropocene within the two highly influential and perennially popular storytelling modes of fantasy and myth, this book articulates the idea that if humanity is to have a future, it needs stories that articulate visions of a biocentric, ecological civilization. As the two story systems that have been humanity's most advanced technologies for collective dreaming, fantastic fiction and myths are helping us adopt a biocentric lens, re-kin us with other forms of life, and assist us in the transition to an ecological civilization. Deliberately moving away from dystopian narratives toward anticipatory imaginations of sustainable futures, this volume blends chapters by top scholars in the fields of climate fiction, science fiction, fantasy, myth, and Young-Adult literature studies with personal reflections by award-winning authors and illustrators of speculative fiction for young audiences such as Jeff Vandermeer, Shaun Tan, Jane Yolen, Katherine Applegate and Joseph Bruchac. Covering the works of major fantasy authors such as J. R. R. Tolkien, Terry Prachett, J. K. Rowling, China Mieville, Barbara Henderson, Jeanette Winterson, John Crowly, Richard Powers, George R. R. Martin and Kim Stanley Robinson, and offering interrogations of cultural expressions set in or from the UK, USA, Nigeria, Ghana, Pacific Islands, New Zealand and Australia, this book frames fantasy and myth as spaces where visions of sustainable futures can be designed with most detail and nuance. Rather than merely criticizing the ecocidal status quo, the book asks how Fantastic stories can mobilize resistance around ideas necessary for the emergence of an ecological civilization""--",1350203378,9781350203372,N/A,Ecocriticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=S6D1zgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=S6D1zgEACAAJ&dq=fantasy&hl=&cd=194&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=S6D1zgEACAAJ&dq=fantasy&hl=&source=gbs_api
Fantasy Freaks and Gaming Geeks,Ethan Gilsdorf,Rowman & Littlefield,2009-09,"Fantasy. Science fiction. Role-playing games. People around the globe turn away from the “real” world to inhabit others. Movie fan-freaks design costumes and collect Lord of the Rings action figures. Some attend comic book conventions and Renaissance fairs, others play live-action role-playing games (LARPs). The online game World of Warcraft (WoW) has lured twelve million users worldwide. Even old-school role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) are still wildly popular. What could one man find if he embarked on a journey through fantasy world after fantasy world? In an enthralling blend of travelogue, pop culture analysis, and memoir, forty- year-old former D&D addict Ethan Gilsdorf crisscrosses America, the world, and other worlds—from Boston to New Zealand, and Planet Earth to the realm of Aggramar. On a quest that begins in his own geeky teenage past and ends in our online gaming future, he asks gaming and fantasy geeks how they balance their escapist urges with the kingdom of adulthood. He speaks to grown men who build hobbit holes, and to grown women who play massively multiplayer online games. He seeks out those who dream of elves, long swords, and heroic deeds, and mentally inhabit faraway magical lands. What lures them—old, young, male, female, able-bodied, and disabled—into fantasy worlds, and for what reasons, whether healthy, unhealthy, or in between? Our noble hero battles online goblins, trolls, and sorcerers for weeks on end. He travels to pilgrimage sites: Tolkien’s hometown, movie locations, and castles. He hangs out with Harry Potter tribute bands. He LARPs. He goes to fan conventions and gaming tournaments. He camps with medieval re-enactors—12,000 of them. He becomes Ethor, Ethorian, and Ethor-An3. He sews his own tunic. He even plays D&D.

A Phylogenetic Fantasy,Sigmund Freud,Harvard University Press,1987,"This volume heralds the appearance, for the first time in many years, of a totally new document by Sigmund Freud. It is the draft of a lost metapsychological paper, one of twelve essays written during World War I at the peak of the master's powers. Freud intended to publish all twelve in book form, under the title Preliminaries to a Metapsychology, and thereby set out the theoretical foundations of psychoanalysis. Scholars have long lamented the disappearance without a trace of seven of these important essays. Only in 1983 did Ilse Grubrich-Simitis happen upon this draft, in Freud's handwriting, in an old trunk containing papers and documents of his Hungarian collaborator Sándor Ferenczi. With the help of a brief letter Freud had written on the back of the last page, she soon realized that the manuscript she had found was the draft of the final paper in the series. That draft is published here in facsimile, together with a transcription in German of the facsimile and the English translation. In the first part of the draft, which is written in a kind of shorthand, Freud contrasts the three classic transference neuroses: anxiety hysteria, conversion hysteria, and obsessional neurosis. In the second part, which is written in complete sentences, Freud undertakes a daringly speculative ""phylogenetic fantasy"" He explores whether the debilitating illnesses of the neurotic and the psychotic today might have originated long ago as adaptive responses of the entire species to threatening environmental changes or to traumatic events in the prehistory of mankind. In the draft ""Fantasy"" Freud modifies and expands the line of reasoning he began in Totem and Taboo (1912-13) after an intensely productive exchange with Ferenczi about Lamarckian concepts, making this recovered draft of major significance to students not only of psychoanalysis but also of the social sciences, humanities, and natural sciences. Ilse Grubrich-Simitis has contributed a detailed essay, setting the overview in the context of Freud's life, his work, and his historical and scientific prominence. She quotes from relevant letters of Freud and Ferenczi, some published here for the first time.",0674666356,9780674666351,144,Medical,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FMpdOl8-pcoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=FMpdOl8-pcoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=fantasy&hl=&cd=196&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=FMpdOl8-pcoC&dq=fantasy&hl=&source=gbs_api

Tales Before Tolkien,Douglas Allen Anderson,"Random House Digital, Inc.",2003,"TALES BEFORE TOLKIEN The Roots of Modern Fantasy-- Classic Stories that Inspired the Author of The Lord of the Rings Edited and with commentary by Douglas A. Anderson Editor of ""The Annotated Hobbit Once upon a time, fantasy writers were looked down upon by the literary mainstream as purveyors of mere escapism or, at best, bedtime tales fit only for children. Today fantasy novels stand atop the bestseller lists, while fantasy films smash box office records. Fantasy dominates the role-playing and computer gaming industries, and classic works in the genre are taught in schools and universities throughout the world. Credit for this amazing turnaround belongs to one man more than any other: John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, the beloved author of ""The Hobbit and ""The Lord of the Rings. Terry Brooks. David Eddings. George R. R. Martin. Robin Hobb. The top names in modern fantasy all acknowledge J. R. R. Tolkien as their model and master, the author whose work first fired their imaginations and inspired them to create their own epics. But what writers influenced Tolkien himself? Sir Isaac Newton once wrote, ""If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants."" As with the scientific genius of Newton, so, too, with the literary genius of Tolkien. Now internationally recognized Tolkien expert Douglas A. Anderson has gathered the fiction of some of those giants together for the first time in a collection destined to become a classic in its own right. In ""The Golden Key,"" the inspiration for Tolkien's short story ""Smith of Wootton Major, George MacDonald tells the tale of a boy whose quest for the end of the rainbow leads beyond the borders of the world.Andrew Lang's romantic tale, ""The Story of Sigurd,"" features magic rings, an enchanted sword, and a brave hero loved by two beautiful women--and cursed by a ferocious dragon. Tolkien read E. A. Wyke-Smith's ""The Marvelous Land of Snergs"" to his children, delighting in these charming tales of a pixieish people ""only slightly taller than the average table."" Also appearing in this collection is a never-before-published gem by David Lindsay, author of ""Voyage to Arcturus,"" a novel which Tolkien praised highly both as a thriller and as a work of philosophy, religion, and morals. In stories packed with magical journeys, conflicted heroes, and terrible beasts, this extraordinary volume is one that no fan of fantasy or Tolkien should be without. These tales just might inspire a new generation of creative writers.

Lacanian Fantasy,KIRK. TURNER,Routledge,2022-08-02,"Lacanian Fantasy: The Image, Language and Uncertainty addresses the question of how fantasy developed as a psychological concept, particularly as influenced by Sigmund Freud and Jacques Lacan. Kirk Turner moves thematically, from childhood to adulthood, and chronologically, from Freud's earliest theories to Lacan's most complex statements on fantasy towards the end of his career. He explores not only the variations that the concept has undergone throughout its history - from Ancient Greek discourse around phantasia to the present day - but also the changing consequences of its applications. Lacanian Fantasy includes further insights on our current predicament: the age of the social media image and fantasy in the uncertain 'locked down' world of a pandemic. Spanning numerous examples, both historical and recent, this book explores relatable forms of fantasy life. In bridging psychology and philosophy, as well as gender and sexuality studies, it ultimately opens new perspectives on fantasy. This book will be of interest to psychoanalytic practitioners and humanities scholars, as well as students interested in critical theory.",1032105933,9781032105932,272,N/A,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wI3szgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=wI3szgEACAAJ&dq=fantasy&hl=&cd=218&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=wI3szgEACAAJ&dq=fantasy&hl=&source=gbs_api

The Anatomy of National Fantasy,Lauren Berlant,University of Chicago Press,1991-08-13,"Examining the complex relationships between the political, popular, sexual, and textual interests of Nathaniel Hawthorne's work, Lauren Berlant argues that Hawthorne mounted a sophisticated challenge to America's collective fantasy of national unity. She shows how Hawthorne's idea of citizenship emerged from an attempt to adjudicate among the official and the popular, the national and the local, the collective and the individual, utopia and history. At the core of Berlant's work is a three-part study of The Scarlet Letter, analyzing the modes and effects of national identity that characterize the narrator's representation of Puritan culture and his construction of the novel's political present tense. This analysis emerges from an introductory chapter on American citizenship in the 1850s and a following chapter on national fantasy, ranging from Hawthorne's early work ""Alice Doane's Appeal"" to the Statue of Liberty. In her conclusion, Berlant suggests that Hawthorne views everyday life and local political identities as alternate routes to the revitalization of the political and utopian promises of modern national life.",0226043770,9780226043777,277,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jtRC6wAGeGoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=jtRC6wAGeGoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=fantasy&hl=&cd=221&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=jtRC6wAGeGoC&dq=fantasy&hl=&source=gbs_api

How to Misunderstand Tolkien,Bruno Bacelli,McFarland,2022-09-16,"J.R.R. Tolkien is an author beloved by many, but people forget the hostile reception of his work from several literary critics, who despised (and some who continue to despise) him and his readers. Other intellectuals and critics have a more positive opinion of his work, but some read aspects of his books or his beliefs to fit their own agendas. Over the decades, scholars have claimed that Tolkien represents a myriad of (sometimes contradictory) political positions. Whether these scholars act out of disdain for Tolkien or from a simple misread of his works, the outcome is a muddled distortion of who Tolkien really was. This book peels back the discourse in an attempt to reveal the true nature of an author who so often defies categorization. Using all possible nuance, chapters explore the villains of Lord of the Rings, its female heroines and its moral compass, as well as its definitions of heroism and failure. This book hopes to provide a uniquely accurate and objective assessment of one of the most misunderstood writers of our time.",1476686947,9781476686943,202,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FIGKEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=FIGKEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=fantasy&hl=&cd=224&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=FIGKEAAAQBAJ&dq=fantasy&hl=&source=gbs_api

The Cambridge Companion to Fantasy Literature,"Edward James, Farah Mendlesohn",Cambridge University Press,2012-01-26,"Fantasy is a creation of the Enlightenment and the recognition that excitement and wonder can be found in imagining impossible things. From the ghost stories of the Gothic to the zombies and vampires of twenty-first-century popular literature, from Mrs Radcliffe to Ms Rowling, the fantastic has been popular with readers. Since Tolkien and his many imitators, however, it has become a major publishing phenomenon. In this volume, critics and authors of fantasy look at the history of fantasy since the Enlightenment, introduce readers to some of the different codes for the reading and understanding of fantasy and examine some of the many varieties and subgenres of fantasy; from magical realism at the more literary end of the genre, to paranormal romance at the more popular end. The book is edited by the same pair who edited The Cambridge Companion to Science Fiction (winner of a Hugo Award in 2005).",0521429595,9780521429597,0,Literary Criticism,en,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=BSPG0AEACAAJ&dq=fantasy&hl=&cd=233&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=BSPG0AEACAAJ&dq=fantasy&hl=&source=gbs_api
The Grammar of Fantasy,Gianni Rodari,Enchanted Lion,2024-05-16,"A collection of essays from the visionary storyteller Gianni Rodari about fairy tales and folk tales and their great advantages in teaching creative storytelling. ""Rodari grasped children's need to play with life's rules by using the grammar of their own imaginations. They must be encouraged to question, challenge, destroy, mock, eliminate, generate, and reproduce their own language and meanings through stories that will enable them to narrate their own lives."" --Jack Zipes ""I hope this small book,"" writes renowned children's author Gianni Rodari, ""can be useful for all those people who believe it is necessary for the imagination to have a place in education; for all those who trust in the creativity of children; and for all those who know the liberating value of the word."" Full of ideas, glosses on fairytales, stories, and wide-ranging activities, including the fantastic binomial, this book changed how creative arts were taught in Italian schools. Translated into English by acclaimed children's historian Jack Zipes and illustrated for the first time ever by Matthew Forsythe, this edition of The Grammar of Fantasy is one to live with and return to for its humor, intelligence, and truly deep understanding of children. A groundbreaking pedagogical work that is also a handbook for writers of all ages and kinds, The Grammar of Fantasy gives each of us a playful, practical path to finding our own voice through the power of storytelling. Gianni Rodari (1920-1980) grew up in Northern Italy and wrote hundreds of stories, poems, and songs for children. In 1960, he collaborated with the Education Cooperation Movement to develop exercises to encourage children's creative and critical thinking abilities. Jack Zipes is a renowned children's historian and folklorist who has written, translated, and edited dozens of books on fairytales. He is a professor at the University of Minnesota.

Romance. Magic. Danger. Impossible odds. Enter When Worlds Begin, and dive into four full fantasy novels. Each world is different. Each story is built to whisk you away. A boy whose love is stronger than magic. He'll save the girl who holds his heart, no matter the cost. An assassin with the courage to topple kingdoms. They shouldn't have let her live. She will be the one to end them all. A girl who clings to hope at the end of the world. She didn't know the safety she lived in was a lie. The monsters are the only ones she can trust. An orphan finds adventures that reach new realms. She knew she was a witch. No one warned her that magic would force her into battle. All of these adventures wait for you. If you need romance, crave adventure, and aren't afraid to leap into a new world, When Worlds Begin is the four-book collection for you. When Worlds Begin includes Ember and Stone, Girl of Glass, The Tethering, and The Girl Without Magic. Readers rave about the four novels included in the When Worlds Begin boxset. “I really enjoyed this novel! It’s on the same level as The Hunger Games.” – BookBub Review of Girl of Glass “It's the magic we loved in Harry Potter, but happening right here and right now in the US.” – Amazon review of The Tethering “This reminded me of Doctor Who, except from the standpoint of the Doctor's assistant.” – Goodreads Review of The Girl Without Magic “David fights Goliath that will pass the Bechdel Test!” – Amazon review of Ember and Stone Ember and Stone (Ena of Ilbrea, Book One) Ena never hoped for a peaceful life. She never dreamt she'd become a killer either. After her home is reduced to ash, Ena is swallowed by a world of secrets and magic. Legends warned of dark shadows hiding in the mountains. They didn't warn of the dangers of falling in love with a myth. Girl of Glass (Girl of Glass, Book One) The world is ending, but Nola has been chosen to survive. This young adult dystopian novel looks at the apocalypse from the point of view of one of the few who has been chosen to survive. Blended with romance and a hint of paranormal, Girl of Glass asks the reader what the obligation of the privileged is to help the suffering. The Tethering (The Tethering, Book One) A dark spell may separate them forever. When fate binds Jacob and Emilia together, war threatens to destroy all they hold dear. Wizards are under attack, and Jacob and Emilia find themselves at the center of a battle that will decide the survival of magic. Facing an enemy that can shatter their souls, will they find love or be devoured by flames? The Girl Without Magic (The Chronicles of Maggie Trent, Book One) Death would have been easier, but the Siren wasn't through with her. The Siren dragged Maggie Trent out of a battle and into her Realm, a land where secrets hide in the shadows and pleasure comes at a price Maggie is unwilling to pay. With the promise of adventure in new worlds, Maggie leaps into a journey of blood and romance. *** When Worlds Begin is a four-book, series-starter collection for YA readers who love paranormal romance but just can't decide which of Megan's series to read first/next! The four young adult novels in When Worlds Begin all feature strong female main characters, runaways, hidden worlds, societal oppression, class differences, women in fiction, and, of course, all the adventure you could ask for! So, whether you're in the mood for witchcraft and wizardry, feminism in fantasy―be it urban or epic―myths and legends, or dystopian darkness hiding behind a utopian façade, When Worlds Begin has something for everyone! *** When Worlds Begin is perfect for fans of Kami Garcia, Rick Riordan, Missy Sheldrake, Anthea Sharp, J.

Ellipse of Uncertainty,Lance Olsen,Praeger,1987,"This fascinating study of literary theory is the first work of its kind to examine the intersection of fantasy and postmodernism, and to analyze contemporary fantasy writers comparatively. After carefully developing working definitions of postmodernism and fantasy, the author goes on to analyze works by various postmodernist fantasy writers. Olsen's approach is eclectic, bringing to each text or textual complex those forces he feels most interestingly stir up its sediment--be they biographical, structural, psychoanalytic, philosophical, reader-response, or otherwise. Finally he argues that postmodern fantasy is the literary equivalent of deconstructionism, for it interrogates all we take for granted about language and experience, giving these no more than shifting and provisional status. It may be seen as a mode of radical skepticism that believes only in the possiblilty of total intelligibility.",N/A,N/A,160,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=udwZAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=udwZAAAAMAAJ&q=fantasy&dq=fantasy&hl=&cd=240&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=udwZAAAAMAAJ&dq=fantasy&hl=&source=gbs_api

The book focuses on the ways these fantasy works have appropriated and adapted Irish and Welsh medieval literature in order to highlight different perceptions of “Celticity.” The term “Celtic” itself is interrogated in light of recent debates in Celtic studies, in order to explore a fictional representation of a national past that is often romanticized and political.",1137552824,9781137552822,311,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VUtGDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=VUtGDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=fantasy&hl=&cd=243&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VUtGDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

It is also important for its exploration of the socialist themes that interested Morris.

"Wizards, Aliens, and Starships",Charles L. Adler,Princeton University Press,2014-02-02,"Explaining the science behind science fiction and fantasy—from the probable to the impossible From teleportation and space elevators to alien contact and interstellar travel, science fiction and fantasy writers have come up with some brilliant and innovative ideas. Yet how plausible are these ideas--for instance, could Mr. Weasley's flying car in the Harry Potter books really exist? Which concepts might actually happen, and which ones wouldn’t work at all? Wizards, Aliens, and Starships delves into the most extraordinary details in science fiction and fantasy--such as time warps, shape changing, rocket launches, and illumination by floating candle--and shows readers the physics and math behind the phenomena. With simple mathematical models, and in most cases using no more than high school algebra, Charles Adler ranges across a plethora of remarkable imaginings, from the works of Ursula K. Le Guin to Star Trek and Avatar, to explore what might become reality. Adler explains why fantasy in the Harry Potter and Dresden Files novels cannot adhere strictly to scientific laws, and when magic might make scientific sense in the muggle world. He examines space travel and wonders why it isn’t cheaper and more common today. Adler also discusses exoplanets and how the search for alien life has shifted from radio communications to space-based telescopes. He concludes by investigating the future survival of humanity and other intelligent races. Throughout, he cites an abundance of science fiction and fantasy authors, and includes concise descriptions of stories as well as an appendix on Newton's laws of motion. Wizards, Aliens, and Starships will speak to anyone wanting to know about the correct--and incorrect--science of science fiction and fantasy.",0691147159,9780691147154,392,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AWeYDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=AWeYDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=fantasy&hl=&cd=247&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=AWeYDwAAQBAJ&dq=fantasy&hl=&source=gbs_api
Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair. By:William Morris,William Morris,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,2016-11-28,"Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair is a fantasy novel by William Morris, perhaps the first modern fantasy writer to unite an imaginary world with the element of the supernatural, and thus the precursor of much of present-day fantasy literature.Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair, set in the forested land of Oakenrealm, was Morris' reimagining and recasting of the medieval Lay of Havelock the Dane, with his displaced royal heirs Christopher and Goldilind standing in for the original story's Havelock and Goldborough. In contrast to his source, Morris emphasizes the romantic aspect of the story, giving a prominent place to the heroine's misfortunes and bringing to the forefront the love story between her and the hero; the warfare by which the hero regains his heritage is relegated to a secondary role. Also unlike both the source and most of Morris's other fantasies, there is little or no supernatural element in this version of the story. Christopher is portrayed as initially ignorant of his true identity, leading to an emotional conflict between the protagonists to reconcile their mutual love and attraction with what they believe to be the profound disparity in their social status and shame of their forced marriage. This situation is resolved when the two fall in with Jack of the Tofts, who gives refuge to Christopher after his sons rescue the hero from an assassination attempt by a servant of the usurper Earl Rolf. Jack informs Christopher of his true station and gathers together an army to help him challenge the usurper. When the hosts meet, the commander of Rolf's forces, Baron Gandolf of Brimside, challenges Jack to single combat, but Christopher claims the honor from Jack and proves his worth by defeating the opposing champion....................... William Morris (24 March 1834 - 3 October 1896) was an English textile designer, poet, novelist, translator, and socialist activist. Associated with the British Arts and Crafts Movement, he was a major contributor to the revival of traditional British textile arts and methods of production. His literary contributions helped to establish the modern fantasy genre, while he played a significant role in propagating the early socialist movement in Britain. Born in Walthamstow, Essex, to a wealthy middle-class family, Morris came under the strong influence of medievalism while studying Classics at Oxford University, there joining the Birmingham Set. After university he trained as an architect, married Jane Burden, and developed close friendships with the Pre-Raphaelite artists Edward Burne-Jones and Dante Gabriel Rossetti and with the Neo-Gothic architect Philip Webb. Webb and Morris designed a family home, Red House, then in Kent, where the latter lived from 1859 to 1865, before moving to Bloomsbury, central London. In 1861, Morris founded a decorative arts firm with Burne-Jones, Rossetti, Webb, and others: the Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co. Becoming highly fashionable and much in demand, the firm profoundly influenced interior decoration throughout the Victorian period, with Morris designing tapestries, wallpaper, fabrics, furniture, and stained glass windows. In 1875, Morris assumed total control of the company, which was renamed Morris & Co.

Between Culture and Fantasy,Gillian Gillison,University of Chicago Press,1993-07,"The myths of the Gimi, a people of the Eastern Highlands of Papua New Guinea, attribute the origin of death and misery to the incestuous desires of the first woman or man, as if one sex or the other were guilty of the very first misdeed. Working for years among the Gimi, speaking their language, anthropologist Gillian Gillison gained rare insight into these myths and their pervasive influence in the organization of social life. Hers is a fascinating account of relations between the sexes and the role of myth in the transition between unconscious fantasy and cultural forms. Gillison shows how the themes expressed in Gimi myths—especially sexual hostility and an obsession with menstrual blood—are dramatized in the elaborate public rituals that accompany marriage, death, and other life crises. The separate myths of Gimi women and men seem to speak to one another, to protest, alter, and enlarge upon myths of the other sex. The sexes cast blame in the veiled imagery of myth and then play out their debate in joint rituals, cooperating in shows of conflict and resolution that leave men undefeated and accord women the greater blame for misfortune.",0226293815,9780226293813,416,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8lvNrY2cUMAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=8lvNrY2cUMAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=fantasy&hl=&cd=250&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=8lvNrY2cUMAC&dq=fantasy&hl=&source=gbs_api
How Fantasy Becomes Reality,Karen Dill-Shackleford,N/A,2023,"It's a common belief that the stories we encounter through mass media - whether in video games, action movies, or political comedy skits on Saturday Night Live - are just entertaining fantasies that have no tangible impact on our everyday lives, attitudes, & choices. Not so, says Karen Dill in this lively & provocative book. As much as we may want to deny it, the images, sounds, & narratives that bombard us daily have ample power to alter our realities. Dill, the author of the single-most-cited study on the effects of video-game violence, draws on extensive research in social psychology to show not only the myriad ways - for good & ill - that media influence us, but also why we resist believing they do. Vibrantly written & packed with examples from everyday life, her wide-ranging analysis encompasses everything from gender & racial stereotyping to social identity, domestic violence, & presidential politics.",0197735738,9780197735732,0,Mass media,en,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=3D9f0AEACAAJ&dq=fantasy&hl=&cd=251&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=3D9f0AEACAAJ&dq=fantasy&hl=&source=gbs_api

Fantasy and Reality in History,Peter Loewenberg,Oxford University Press,1995-10-19,"In Fantasy and Reality in History, Peter Loewenberg brings what the discipline of psychoanalysis has learned about human conduct and the irrational to bear on the analysis and writing of history. The result is a remarkable series of studies on individual and social anxiety, racism and nationalism, and crisis management. First examining early twentieth century Zürich and the first practitioners of psychoanalysis--Freud, C.G. Jung, Karl Abraham, and others--to establish the discipline's understanding of the unconscious and how it functions, Loewenberg then explores the tensions in the lives and politics of modern political leaders. The great British Liberal Prime Minister Walther Rathenau, and the Russian fascist demagogue Vladimir Zhirinovsky are among those studied. In each of these interconnected essays, Fantasy and Reality in History makes readily evident the advantages, and unique insights, that psychoanalytical techniques can provide in the examination of history. Loewenberg's blend of clinical and historico-political methods not only produces new exciting research, but demonstrates how it is done.",019536189X,9780195361896,246,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SL7yDvso7a0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=SL7yDvso7a0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=fantasy&hl=&cd=260&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SL7yDvso7a0C&source=gbs_api

Fantasy and Your Family,Richard Abanes,N/A,2002,"Fantasy and Your Family by bestselling author Richard Abanes presents a much-needed assessment of fantasy - its benefits and its drawbacks. Abanes begins with an in-depth look at folklore, myths, legends, and fairy tales, and their connection to fantasy. Part one also discusses issues involving child development, the affects of literature on children, and how those affects can ultimately change the course of society. Additionally, Abanes examines pop culture, the media, mass marketing, and the commercialization of children's literature by corporations interested primarily in making money. This volume then looks at the life of fantasy writer J.R.R. Tolkien, the popularity of his fantasy works, their content, and what separates them from other fantasy volumes such as Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling and the children's horror books by R.L. Stine. A particularly interesting survey of Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings includes a thorough analysis of its storyline, characters, and morality. These are compared side-by-side with Harry Potter. Finally, Abanes gives an overview of our culture's growing obsession with the occult, paganism, and witchcraft. Why is it happening? When did it begin? How is it influencing today's youth? All of these questions are answered through a concise, easy-to-understand writing style. Especially fascinating are the numerous sources of documentations that shows children are indeed being drawn to the occult via Harry Potter. Included are dozens of quotes by Wiccans, neopagans, and occultists that clearly express their belief that Rowling's fantasy will do much to further witchcraft and the occult. - Amazon.",0875099750,9780875099750,348,Education,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1_KmBsGozhkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,1,1,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=1_KmBsGozhkC&q=fantasy&dq=fantasy&hl=&cd=263&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=1_KmBsGozhkC&dq=fantasy&hl=&source=gbs_api
Medea,Esa Roos,Routledge,2015,"This book takes Euripides tragedy of Medea as its starting point. Our unconscious fantasies can be embedded in age-old myths, and many modern works about Medea reflect our ever-present interest in such myths. The Danish film director T.H. Dreyer had plans to produce a film about the story of Medea, while his countryman Lars von Trier did in fact make his own version of Medea, based on Dreyer`s previous work on the theme. In this remarkable new book the `Medea fantasy is introduced as an unconscious determinant of psychogenic sterility, a fantasy that may form an unrecognized and dissociated part of the self-representation. The book describes how this can lead women to believe that their lovers (like Jason in the original myth) will deceive and abandon them, and that this anxiety might cause them to react violently towards their children. For such women it is imperative to forgo any creative femininity.",1782202919,9781782202912,187,Psychology,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gXVazAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=gXVazAEACAAJ&dq=fantasy&hl=&cd=264&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=gXVazAEACAAJ&dq=fantasy&hl=&source=gbs_api

The Family Trade,Charles Stross,Tor Books,2010-04-01,"A bold fantasy in the tradition of Roger Zelazny's Chronicles of Amber, The Merchant Princes is a sweeping new series from the hottest new writer in science fiction! Miriam Beckstein is happy in her life. She's a successful reporter for a hi-tech magazine in Boston, making good money doing what she loves. When her researcher brings her iron-clad evidence of a money-laundering scheme, Miriam thinks she's found the story of the year. But when she takes it to her editor, she's fired on the spot and gets a death threat from the criminals she has uncovered. Before the day is over, she's received a locket left by the mother she never knew-the mother who was murdered when she was an infant. Within is a knotwork pattern, which has a hypnotic effect on her. Before she knows it, she's transported herself to a parallel Earth, a world where knights on horseback chase their prey with automatic weapons, and where world-skipping assassins lurk just on the other side of reality - a world where her true family runs things. The six families of the Clan rule the kingdom of Gruinmarkt from behind the scenes, a mixture of nobility and criminal conspirators whose power to walk between the worlds makes them rich in both. Braids of family loyalty and intermarriage provide a fragile guarantee of peace, but a recently-ended civil war has left the families shaken and suspicious. Taken in by her mother's people, she becomes the star of the story of the century-as Cinderella without a fairy godmother. As her mother's heir, Miriam is hailed as the prodigal countess Helge Thorold-Hjorth, and feted and feasted. Caught up in schemes and plots centuries in the making, Miriam is surrounded by unlikely allies, forbidden loves, lethal contraband, and, most dangerous of all, her family. Her unexpected return will supercede the claims of other clan members to her mother's fortune and power, and whoever killed her mother will be happy to see her dead, too. Behind all this lie deeper secrets still, which threaten everyone and everything she has ever known. Patterns of deception and interlocking lies, as intricate as the knotwork between the universes. But Miriam is no one's pawn, and is determined to conquer her new home on her own terms. Blending the creativity and humor of Roger Zelazny, the adventure of H.

The Lure of Fantasy Islam,Stephen M. Kirby,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,2017-05-18,"What do Muslims like Zuhdi Jasser, Raheel Raza, and Mike Mohamed Ghouse have in common? They play Fantasy Islam: Fantasy Islam: A game in which an audience of non-Muslims wish with all their hearts that Islam was a ""Religion of Peace,"" and a Muslim strives to fulfill that wish by presenting a personal version of Islam that has little foundation in Islamic Doctrine. This is a game that is even played in the Kafir (disbeliever) edition by non-Muslims like John Esposito, Georgetown University's Professor of Islamic Studies. Have you ever wondered: do Christians, Jews and Muslims really believe in the same God? Does the Koran really praise Jews and command Muslims to treat the People of the Book (Jews and Christians) with respect? Is it really ""radical"" to stone adulterers and cut off the hands of thieves? Can Muslims really reject the Koran? Does the word ""Jihad"" really have nothing to do with a ""Holy War""? Did the Lutheran Social Service of Minnesota really create a book describing its version of Islam that included an endorsement by an imam who appeared to be a Hamas supporter, who referred to Israelis as terrorists, and who believed that Shariah Law should be enforced in American communities where Muslims are the majority? In his fifth book about Islam Dr. Kirby examines these versions of Islam and others like them, and shows how far removed they are from the Islamic Doctrine found in the Koran and the teachings of Muhammad. This book gives you the information you need to counter many of today's popular myths about Islam while gaining a better understanding of that religion.",1546316973,9781546316978,284,N/A,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4Pq9swEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=4Pq9swEACAAJ&dq=fantasy&hl=&cd=283&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=4Pq9swEACAAJ&dq=fantasy&hl=&source=gbs_api

Fantasy Islands,Julie Sze,University of California Press,2015-01-05,"The rise of China and its status as a leading global factory are altering the way people live and consume. At the same time, the world appears wary of the real costs involved. Fantasy Islands probes Chinese, European, and American eco-desire and eco-technological dreams, and examines the solutions they offer to environmental degradation in this age of global economic change. Uncovering the stories of sites in China, including the plan for a new eco-city called Dongtan on the island of Chongming, mega-suburbs, and the Shanghai World Expo, Julie Sze explores the flows, fears, and fantasies of Pacific Rim politics that shaped them. She charts how climate change discussions align with US fears of China's ascendancy and the related demise of the American Century, and she considers the motives of financial and political capital for eco-city and ecological development supported by elite power structures in the UK and China. Fantasy Islands shows how ineffectual these efforts are while challenging us to see what a true eco-city would be.",0520284488,9780520284487,244,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xHl-DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=xHl-DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=fantasy&hl=&cd=291&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=xHl-DwAAQBAJ&dq=fantasy&hl=&source=gbs_api

Nursery Realms,"Gary Westfahl, George Edgar Slusser",University of Georgia Press,1999,"Child characters are surprisingly common in horror, fantasy, and science fiction literature and films. Children represent innocence and virtue and symbolize the classic question of fantastic literature: What is the future of the human race, and how will science and society improve or impair that future? This collection of essays explores the roles of children in the literature and film of the fantastic. The works vary in critical approach from textual analyses to psychological, historical, and gender- and ethnicity-based interpretations and draw their subject matter from contemporary and classic literary and film pieces. ""The Triumph of Teen Prop: Terminator II and the End of History"" is a playful discussion of teen propaganda movies and social issues. ""E.T. as Fairy Tale"" examines how Stephen Spielberg's combination of science fiction, fantasy, and fairy tale elements blends logic and childhood magic. Howard M. Lenhoff connects mythical creatures with biology in ""A Real-World Source for the 'Little People': A Comparison of Fairies to Individuals with Williams Syndrome."" The literary selection ranges from Alida Allison's study of childhood in Isaac Bashevis Singer's writings to Bud Foote's interpretation of childhood roles in the characters of selected Stephen King works.

Bread of Dreams,Piero Camporesi,Wiley-Blackwell,1989,"In a rich an engaging book that illuminates the lives and attitudes of peasants in preindustrial Europe, Piero Camporesi makes the unexpected and fascinating claim that these people lived in a state of almost permanent hallucination, drugged by their very hunger or by bread adulterated with hallucinogenic herbs. The use of opiate products, administered even to infants and children, was widespread and was linked to a popular mythology in which herbalists and exorcists were important cultural figures. Through a careful reconstruction of the everyday lives of peasants, beggars, and the poor, Camporesi presents a vivid and disconcerting image of early modern Europe as a vast laboratory of dreams. ""Camporesi is as much a poet as a historian. . . . His appeal is to the senses as well as to the mind. . . . Fascinating in its details and compelling in its overall message."" --Vivian Nutton, ""Times Literary Supplement"" ""It is not often that an academic monograph in history is also a book to fascinate the discriminating general reader. ""Bread of Dreams"" is just that."" --Kenneth McNaught, ""Toronto Star"" ""Not religion but bread was the opiate of the poor, Mr. Camporesi argues. . . . Food has always been a social and mythological construct that conditions what we vainly imagine to be matters of personal taste. Our hunger for such works should tell us that food is not only good but essential to think and to read as if our lives depended on it, which they do."" --Betty Fussell, ""New York Times Book Review"" Piero Camporesi is professor of Italian literature at the University of Bologna. He is the author of numerous works including ""La Casa Dell'Eternita and La Carne Impassabile""(published in English translation as ""The Incorruptible Flesh.""",0745603491,9780745603490,212,Europe,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HLDDQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=HLDDQgAACAAJ&dq=fantasy&hl=&cd=297&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=HLDDQgAACAAJ&dq=fantasy&hl=&source=gbs_api

The Happiness Fantasy,Carl Cederström,Polity,2018-11-19,"In this devastatingly witty new book, Carl Cederström traces our present-day conception of happiness from its roots in early-twentieth-century European psychiatry, to the Beat generation, to Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump. He argues that happiness is now defined by a desire to be ""authentic"", to experience physical pleasure, and to cultivate a quirky individuality. But over the last fifty years, these once-revolutionary ideas have been co-opted by corporations and advertisers, pushing us to live lives that are increasingly unfulfilling, insecure and narcissistic. In an age of increasing austerity and social division, Cederström argues that a radical new dream of happiness is gathering pace. There is a vision of the good life which promotes deeper engagement with the world and our place within it, over the individualism and hedonism of previous generations. Guided by this more egalitarian worldview, we can reinvent ourselves and our societies.",1509523804,9781509523801,0,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=u-NVtAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=u-NVtAEACAAJ&dq=fantasy&hl=&cd=300&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=u-NVtAEACAAJ&dq=fantasy&hl=&source=gbs_api

Rhosynora Ravenwood spends her sleepless nights fantasizing of ways to escape her icy, suffocating dynasty. To flee her birthright is to invite a traitor’s penance. To stay is another kind of death.

Challenging the Fantasy Bond,Robert Firestone,N/A,2022,"""Why are many of us compelled to repeat the pain of our past, while avoiding positive experiences that could enrich our lives? In this thought-provoking book, clinical psychologist and theorist Robert Firestone explains how the fantasy bond, an illusion of connection, develops to protect us from negative experiences with parents or caregivers. Later in life, the fantasy bond manifests itself in destructive internal voices and imagined connections to family members, intimate partners, and social groups. Compelling case studies illustrate how these negative voices interfere with true intimacy, and demonstrate how Voice Therapy, a cognitive/affective/behavioral methodology, can be used to counteract destructive internal messages and help individuals embrace the present, instead of living in the past. Challenging our illusions of a merged identity, and moving toward separation and individuation are essential if we are to become fully autonomous human beings. This thorough update of a classic work is particularly timely because it also identifies existential fears that contribute to death anxiety, prejudice, and political divisiveness""--",1433835819,9781433835810,N/A,Defense mechanisms (Psychology),en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=22uKzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=22uKzgEACAAJ&dq=fantasy&hl=&cd=328&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=22uKzgEACAAJ&dq=fantasy&hl=&source=gbs_api

Endangered,W. Bradford Swift,Porpoise Publishing,N/A,"Fantasy Book with Animals: Protecting the planet: a thankless job and one that has no breaks! For Zak Bates and his magical friends, the next eco-adventures is usually right around the corner. A fishy reconnaissance mission in the Illinois River leads them to Florida, and it’s there, in the everglades, Ohnmar appears...a very displeased and displaced python. Having been abandoned by his caregiver, who seems to have cared very little, Ohnmar teaches Zak a lesson that may prove useful when an emergency in Ohio demands the gang’s presence. In Zanesville, Ohio, a dangerous menagerie has escaped from a private preserve, and the situation threatens to spiral out of control. Francis, a spirit bear from British Columbia is being held captive, and, to free him, the Eco-Adventurers will need to align with Chatters, a white (knight) squirrel. Though fraught with peril, the breakout might be a chance to mend the globe. A call to arms, to wings and fins... An eloquent environmental message for our times! Endangered is a Zak Bates Eco-Adventure novel that will entertain and enlighten young minds. Fabulous fiction and terrible truths: a romping exploration of the perils faced by our animal friends, posterity, and planet. Review: Not Just for Kids: Although the books are written a little simmer than my normal novel, I found them to be fun and smart. When I finished the first one I couldn't wait to start this one. These books actually put me in the story and for a while, I forgot they were make-believe. No, they're not War and Peace, however, they are a great way to get away from it all while smiling the whole time. These books both are highly recommended-but only to people who love life and don't take themselves too seriously. As for the younger set-what a fun way to learn about some of today's lessons about life, our planet, and all we share it with.

Snow So White,C. Gockel,C. Gockel,2022-10-20,"Once upon a future-time, in a city of steel, concrete, and Magick, a wicked queen trapped a mighty warrior with a curse ... In the tiny village of Somer, far from the city, Cherie knows nothing of the evil spell. Her home is a safe, Magickal place. The Fae travel freely along its roads, Magickal humans and animals are welcome, and everyone is hidden from the Queen’s sight by Jack Frost, the local ghost, who blurs the Queen’s mirror with snow and ice. But when Jack’s spell begins to crack, the Queen’s eyes fall on Somer. Nothing will keep her from abducting all of Somer’s Magickals, not even a war with the Fae. To avert a war, save her village--and herself--Cherie strikes a perilous bargain. Aided only by Jack and her own small Magick, she’ll set off on a quest … If she fails, she’ll lose more than her life. A retelling of Snow White and Rose Red with Urban Magick, plenty of folklore and mythology, and a Princess Charming. Perfect for fans of Naomi Novik’s Uprooted and Spinning Silver.

The Fantasy Passport: Sailing on Faith,Robert J. Green,AbsolutelyAmazingebooks.com,2022-03-23,"After serving more than twenty years as an organist in his church, the author took to the pulpit as a volunteer lay preacher. As a man of faith and reason, unbound by the usual constraints upon professional clergymen, he speaks his mind freely and openly as he addresses many of the perplexing issues confronting contemporary religion. In the process he proposes some unconventional answers, and makes some surprising revelations. He is not your typical clergyman, and this is not your typical book of sermons.

Lilith (1895). by George MacDonald,George MacDonald,N/A,2016-12-10,"Lilith is a fantasy novel written by Scottish writer George MacDonald and first published in 1895. Its importance was recognized in its later revival in paperback by Ballantine Books as the fifth volume of the celebrated Ballantine Adult Fantasy series in September 1969.Lilith is considered among the darkest of MacDonald's works, and among the most profound. It is a story concerning the nature of life, death, and salvation. In the story, MacDonald mentions a cosmic sleep that heals tortured souls, preceding the salvation of all. MacDonald was a Christian universalist, believing that all will eventually be saved. However, in this story, divine punishment is not taken lightly, and salvation is hard-won.Mr. Vane, the protagonist of Lilith, owns a library that seems to be haunted by the former librarian, who looks much like a raven from the brief glimpses he catches of the wraith. After finally encountering the supposed ghost, the mysterious Mr. Raven, Vane learns that Raven had known his father; indeed, Vane's father had visited the strange parallel universe from which Raven comes and goes and now resides therein. Vane follows Raven into the world through a mirror (this symbolistic realm is described as ""the region of the seven dimensions"", a term taken from Jacob Boehme). Inside the world, Vane learns of a house of beds where the dreamers sleep until the end of the world in death: a good death, in which life is found. Vane's grandfather refused to sleep there and is, instead, forced to do battle with skeletons in a haunted wood. After a treacherous journey through a valley (where the moon is the only thing to keep him safe), Mr. Vane meets the Little Ones, children who never grow up, remaining pure children or becoming selfish and getting bigger and dumber, turning into ""bags"" or bad giants. After conversing with Lona, the eldest of the children, Mr. Vane decides to help them, and sets off to gather more information, although the Raven (who is also Adam) has warned Mr. Vane that he needs to sleep along with the dreamers before he can really help them. While on his journey, he meets Lilith, Adam's first wife and the princess of Bulika. Vane, although nearly blinded by Lilith's beauty and charms, eventually leads the Little Ones in a battle against Bulika. Lona, Vane's love, turns out to be Lilith's daughter, and is killed by her own mother. Lilith, however, is captured and brought to Adam and Eve at the house of death, where they struggle to make her open her hand, fused shut, in which she holds the water the Little Ones need to grow. Only when she gives it up can Lilith join the sleepers in blissful dreams, free of sin. After a long struggle, Lilith bids Adam cut her hand from her body; it is done, Lilith sleeps, and Vane is sent to bury the hand; water flows from the hole and washes the land over. Vane is then allowed to join the Little Ones, already asleep, in their dreaming. He takes his bed, next to Lona's, and finds true life in death....",1541035135,9781541035133,172,N/A,en,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=5zhbMQAACAAJ&dq=fantasy&hl=&cd=337&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=5zhbMQAACAAJ&dq=fantasy&hl=&source=gbs_api

The Feast of Fools,Harvey Cox,Cambridge : Harvard University Press,1969,"In this fascinating interpretation of contemporary culture and theology, Harvey Cox examines both the loss and reemergence of festivity and fantasy in Western civilization. He evaluates both processes from a theological perspective, defining festivity as the capacity for genuine revelry and joyous celebration and defining fantasy as the faculty for envisioning radically alternative life situations. He asserts that both are absolutely vital to contemporary human life and faith; both are a precondition for genuine social transformation. In a success and money-oriented society we need a rebirth of unapologetically unproductive festivity and expressive celebration. In an age that has quarantined parody and separated politics from imagination, we need a renaissance of social fantasy. It has been said over and over again that affluent Western man has been gaining the whole world while losing his soul. In the face of this Mr. Cox affirms the possibility and necessity of a resurgence of hope, celebration, liberation, and experimentation. The medieval Feast of Fools, from which he has taken his title, symbolizes both the problem and the process. Centuries ago it provided an opportunity for the choirboy to play bishop and for serious townsfolk to mock the stately rituals of church and court. The eventual disappearance of the custom in the sixteenth century, unlamented if not welcomed by those in authority, illustrates the concerns of this provocative and controversial essay. Mr. Cox does not propose that a medieval practice should be revived, but he does argue for a rebirth in our own cultural idiom of what was right and good about the Feast of Fools. It is likely that this book will become significant in wide circles. It speaks directly to such contemporary movements as the theology of hope, the rapidly disappearing radical theology, and the theology of culture. For many it will provide a new perspective on the renewal of religious life and the secular search for religious experience. For others it will function as a window into the experimental laboratories of the so-called ""underground church."" For everyone it is a refreshing encounter with a wholly new set of perceptive observations about the problems that plague us.",N/A,N/A,228,Psychology,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0_3YAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=0_3YAAAAMAAJ&q=fantasy&dq=fantasy&hl=&cd=340&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=0_3YAAAAMAAJ&dq=fantasy&hl=&source=gbs_api

Warped Line,Ann Gimpel,"Ann Gimpel Books, LLC",2020-05-26,"I chose stasis—a long sleep—for me and two of mine. Hard to time these things, but we woke in the eye of a cyclone. When I went to sleep—to avoid being drained of magic and blood by dark Sorcerers—Vampires weren’t exactly on the endangered species list, but not many of us are left. No one ever accepted us. Not mortals and not others with power, either. At least one of those dams has developed a few cracks. Supernaturals aren’t quite welcoming, but they’ll take help from any quarter. Mortals have declared war on magic, and they won’t rest until we’re all sitting in iron-clad prisons. What a bunch of cowards. If they weren’t hiding behind false humanitarian walls, they’d be honest about their intentions and kill us outright if they could. The world turned into an alien place while I slept. Not much point returning to my clan house in Italy. It’s probably long since disbanded. Besides, fate tossed me squarely in Ariana’s path. She’s like me, a Vampire, but I hunger for her in a very un-Vampirelike way. She’s done her damnedest to chase me away, but I’m tough to dissuade.

These dwellings have been meticulously created from the imagination of a bona fide television addict, artist Mark Bennett. As a child growing up in Tennessee, 40-year-old Mark Bennett was less concerned about the ""real world"" than with the lives of our beloved television families who brightened his world every day: the Bradys, the Cunninghams, the Cleavers - even those creepy Munsters. Herein are fascinating and obscure details which are the result of 25 years - and thousands of hours - of television viewing. How many rooms were there in the Clampett mansion in ""The Beverly Hillbillies"", and where was Granny's moonshine still, in relation to the cement pond? Even if you've never asked yourself these questions, after one glance at TV Sets, you will.

The China Fantasy,James Mann,Penguin,2007-02-15,"The book that got China right: a prophetic work on how America's policies towards China led it away from liberalization and further towards authoritarianism, from the bestselling author of Rise of the Vulcans ""[The China Fantasy] predicted, China would remain an authoritarian country, and its success would encourage other authoritarian regimes to resist pressures to change . . . Mann’s prediction turned out to be true."" -New York Review of Books, October 2017 ""From Clinton to Bush to Obama, the prevailing belief was engagement with China would make China more like the West. Instead, as [James] Mann predicted, China has gone in the opposite direction."" -The New York Times, February 2018 One of our most perceptive China experts, James Mann wrote The China Fantasy as a vital wake-up call to all who are ignorant of America's true relationship with the Asian giant. For years, our leaders posited that China could be drawn to increasing liberalization through the power of the free market, but Mann asked us to consider a very real alternative: What if China's economy continues to expand but its government remains as dismissive of democracy and human rights as it is now? Now the results are in: the reign of Xi Jinping has proven that Mann was right. To understand how China got to its current state and why it may not be too late to turn back, The China Fantasy is essential reading. Calling for an end to the current policy of overlooking China's abuses for the sake of business opportunities, Mann presents an alternative path to a better China.",1101201975,9781101201978,152,Political Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PEtExen-OwAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=PEtExen-OwAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=fantasy&hl=&cd=364&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PEtExen-OwAC&source=gbs_api

Breaking the Angelic Image,Edith Lazaros Honig,Praeger,1988-10-24,"Honig's short, pleasantly written book is a consideration of the images of women--as mothers, spinsters, girls, and supernatural women--in 19th-and early 20th-century fantasy novels for children. . . . Honig sees fantasy as a means of freeing women from the Victorian social restraints--at first, imaginatively. Choice This is the first book-length study of nineteenth-century children's fantasy from a feminist viewpoint. Honig focuses on a number of major works that are representative of the best of their era--including such classics as Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Caroll; The Golden Key, The Princess and the Goblin, and others by George MacDonald; the works of Mary Louisa Molesworth; Peter and Wendy by James Barrie; The Five Children and Itand The Enchanted Castle by Edith Nesbit. Through a close reading of these fantasies Honig demonstrates that although Victorian women were still being repressed in the home and the marketplace, the female figure in literature played a role that was quite different from the traditional stereotype of the meek, submissive wife and mother.",031326127X,9780313261275,0,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gxfDEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=gxfDEAAAQBAJ&dq=fantasy&hl=&cd=367&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=gxfDEAAAQBAJ&dq=fantasy&hl=&source=gbs_api

A 1918 edition from the Modern Library was actually a combined edition with Time and the Gods.The book collects fourteen fantasy short stories by the author.Lord Dunsany employed the talents of Sidney Sime to illustrate his fantasy short story collections, but The Book of Wonder is unique in that Sydney Sime drew the illustrations first, and Lord Dunsany wrote the tales to incorporate them: 'I found Mr Sime one day, in his strange house at Worplesdon, complaining that editors did not offer him very suitable subjects for illustration; so I said: ""Why not do any pictures you like, and I will write stories explaining them, which may add a little to their mystery?""'[1]The short story ""How Nuth Would Have Practised His Art upon the Gnoles"" is likely the origin of the term gnoll, used in a number of later works, notably the Dungeons and Dragons gaming franchise, to describe a humanoid fantasy race.[2",N/A,9798576978328,88,N/A,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=d0MPzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=d0MPzgEACAAJ&dq=fantasy&hl=&cd=368&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=d0MPzgEACAAJ&dq=fantasy&hl=&source=gbs_api

Function and Fantasy: Iron Architecture in the Long Nineteenth Century,"Paul Dobraszczyk, Peter Sealy",Routledge,2016-07-01,"The introduction of iron – and later steel – construction and decoration transformed architecture in the nineteenth century. While the structural employment of iron has been a frequent subject of study, this book re-directs scholarly scrutiny on its place in the aesthetics of architecture in the long nineteenth century. Together, its eleven unique and original chapters chart – for the first time – the global reach of iron’s architectural reception, from the first debates on how iron could be incorporated into architecture’s traditional aesthetics to the modernist cleaving of its structural and ornamental roles. The book is divided into three sections. Formations considers the rising tension between the desire to translate traditional architectural motifs into iron and the nascent feeling that iron buildings were themselves creating an entirely new field of aesthetic expression. Exchanges charts the commercial and cultural interactions that took place between British iron foundries and clients in far-flung locations such as Argentina, Jamaica, Nigeria and Australia. Expressing colonial control as well as local agency, iron buildings struck a balance between pre-fabricated functionalism and a desire to convey beauty, value and often exoticism through ornament. Transformations looks at the place of the aesthetics of iron architecture in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a period in which iron ornament sought to harmonize wide social ambitions while offering the tantalizing possibility that iron architecture as a whole could transform the fundamental meanings of ornament. Taken together, these chapters call for a re-evaluation of modernism’s supposedly rationalist interest in nineteenth-century iron structures, one that has potentially radical implications for the recent ornamental turn in contemporary architecture.",1317131401,9781317131403,326,Architecture,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GS2TDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=GS2TDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=fantasy&hl=&cd=373&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=GS2TDAAAQBAJ&dq=fantasy&hl=&source=gbs_api
