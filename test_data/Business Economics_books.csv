In celebration of the journal's anniversary, The Best of ""Business Economics"" brings together forty of the best articles from half a century of publication: those that pushed boundaries, challenged conventional wisdom, and redefined the way practitioners and academics approached their work.

Loose-Leaf for Managerial Economics,"Christopher R. Thomas, S. Charles Maurice",McGraw-Hill Companies,2023,"""The growing influence of microeconomics and industrial organization economics in every field of business analysis has transformed the role of managerial economics in business school curricula. Economists have understood for some time that every modern course in business strategy and organizational architecture must draw from key areas of advancement in microeconomics and industrial organization. While many business schools have been quick to adopt ""strategy"" as a fundamental theme in their curricula, this new emphasis on strategy too often falls on the shoulders of a single, one-semester course in business strategy. In a single course, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to teach business students managerial economics and cover all of the valuable topics in business strategy and organization. In any case, a thorough foundation in managerial economics is required in order to understand how to use the many new and important developments in microeconomics and industrial organization. The objective of Managerial Economics, then, is to teach and apply the foundation topics in microeconomics and industrial organization essential for making both the day-to-day business decisions that maximize profit as well as the strategic decisions designed to create and protect profit in the long run. In so doing, we believe Managerial Economics helps business students become architects of business tactics and strategy instead of middle managers who plod along the beaten path of others""--",126493405X,9781264934058,0,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VnzxzwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=VnzxzwEACAAJ&dq=Business+Economics&hl=&cd=46&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=VnzxzwEACAAJ&dq=Business+Economics&hl=&source=gbs_api

Ltd.,2005-03-01,"For courses in managerial economics, this textbook, now in its second edition, is specifically designed for students of management, commerce and economics to provide them with a thorough understanding of economic concepts and methodologies and the economic environment influencing managerial decisions. The book first lays a sound theoretical foundation of basic concepts, definitions, and methodologies of economics, being an essential prerequisite for students to understand the theory of managerial economics. All the basic principles are introduced with mathematical complexity kept to minimum - essentials of applied mathematics needed for comprehending the underlying ideas of models and theories of economics are covered. The book then moves on to systematically enumerate the various tools of analysis such as demand analysis, cost analysis, elasticity of demand, production analysis and price theory, and highlights their importance in managerial decision making through the concept-example format, wherein a concept discussed is immediately followed by a practical situation so that the reader can understand its application. The end-of-chapter questions reinforce a deeper understanding of the concepts introduced in the text. An exclusive chapter on linear programming emphasizes the importance of this mathematical tool in finding optimal business solutions. The book concludes with an exhaustive introduction to macroeconomics, analyzing in depth the concepts of inflation, income, savings and investments, and growth and employment in Indian context. - Extensively revised chapter on microeconomics introduces the students to the concepts of aggregates of income, growth and employment. - Case studies, at the end of all chapters, of real life situations of the Indian economy immensely help in grasping the theoretical concepts.",8120327314,9788120327313,298,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Q6Nr6JDznykC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,5,1,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=Q6Nr6JDznykC&pg=PA26&dq=Business+Economics&hl=&cd=87&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=Q6Nr6JDznykC&dq=Business+Economics&hl=&source=gbs_api

Problems in Business Economics (Classic Reprint),Homer Bews Vanderblue,Forgotten Books,2018-09-14,"Excerpt from Problems in Business Economics The course in advanced Business Economics given in the Harvard Business School seeks to demonstrate the importance, in the forming of executive judgments, of generally accepted eco nomic principles, and especially those economic principles devel oped in recent studies of the business cycle. Most of the cases and problems presented in this'book were gathered by the Harvard Bureau of Business Research for the use of that course; very generally they concern decisions which business men have made since the armistice. For introductory discussion on the business cycle I have drawn freely on the publications of the Harvard University Committee on Economic Research, and especially upon the writings of Professor Warren M. Persons. I am indebted to Professor Charles J. Bullock, the chairman of that committee, and to Professor Persons for permission to present much of the materials contained in Parts I and III. Each of these introduc tory chapters on the Business Cycle (part I) makes reference to cases or problems in Part II, which clearly present the impor tant issues raised in the chapter. Part III contains important statistical series, together with a simplified explanation of the statistical methods devised by Professor Persons and employed by the Harvard Committee in its work. This was prepared by the statistician of the Com mittee, Professor W. L. Crum, for the use of subscribers to the Harvard Economic Service Who might be desirous of comparing statistical series of their own business With the curves of the Harvard Index Chart. This explanation is here included in order that teachers desiring to add laboratory or report work to the requirements of a course in Business Cycles or Business Economics may have a non-mathematical explanation of Pro fessor Persons' methods to place in the hands of their students. It should also be of value to business men desiring to compare the movements of their business with the general business cycle. A more complete explanation appears in Professor Persons' fundamental work, Indices of General Business Conditions.

Elgar Companion to Neo-Schumpeterian Economics,"Horst Hanusch, Andreas Pyka",Edward Elgar Publishing,2007,"The Elgar Companion to Neo-Schumpeterian Economics is a cutting-edge collection of specially commissioned contributions highlighting not only the broad scope but also the common ground between all branches of this prolific and fast developing field of economics. For 25 years economists have been investigating industrial dynamics under the heading of neo-Schumpeterian economics, which has itself become a mature and widely acknowledged discipline in the fields of innovation, knowledge, growth and development economics. The Elgar Companion to Neo-Schumpeterian Economics surveys the achievements of the most visible scholars in this area. The contributions to the Companion give both a brief survey on the various fields of neo-Schumpeterian economics as well as insights into recent research at the scientific frontiers. The book also illustrates the potential of neo-Schumpeterian economics to overcome its so far self-imposed restriction to the domains of technology driven industry dynamics, and to become a comprehensive approach in economics suited for the analysis of development processes in all economic domains. Integrating both the public sector and financial markets, the book focusses on the co-evolutionary processes between the different domains. As a roadmap for the development of a comprehensive neo-Schumpeterian theory, the Companion will be an invaluable source of reference for researchers in the fields of industrial dynamics and economic growth, and academics and scholars of economics generally. PhD students will find the Companion an indispensable general introduction to the field of neo-Schumpeterian economics. It will also appeal to politicians and consultants engaged in national and international policy as the Companion deals with the highly important and ever topical phenomena of economic development.",1847207014,9781847207012,1229,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=P0zUrTYpMnkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,5,1,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=P0zUrTYpMnkC&pg=PA229&dq=Business+Economics&hl=&cd=109&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=P0zUrTYpMnkC&source=gbs_api

Managerial Economics & Organizational Architecture,"James A. Brickley, Clifford Smith, Jerold L. Zimmerman",McGraw-Hill/Irwin,2007,"With two distinct objectives, this text’s approach to managerial economics takes models from recent economics research and applies the research to the internal structure of a firm. After teaching basic applied economics, the authors look inside the firm and apply this analysis to management decision making. Authors Brickley, Smith, and Zimmerman contend that organizational architecture consists of three aspects of corporate organization: the assignment of decision rights within the company; methods of rewarding individuals; the structure of systems to evaluate the performance of both individuals and business units. These three components can be likened to a stool with three legs. If one of the legs is shorter, the stool is out of balance. These three elements must be in balance in the organization as well.",N/A,N/A,760,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lzNEAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=lzNEAAAAYAAJ&q=Business+Economics&dq=Business+Economics&hl=&cd=115&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=lzNEAAAAYAAJ&dq=Business+Economics&hl=&source=gbs_api

Informal Sector Innovations,"Mammo Muchie, Saradindu Bhaduri, Angathevar Baskaran, Fayaz Sheikh",Routledge,2017-10-02,"It is well documented that the space of informal economic activity is rising across the globe. This rise has been particularly significant in the least developed and developing countries, especially after the onset of neo-liberal policies and withdrawal of welfare state. There has also been a shift in academic thinking on informal sector, with attempts being made to understand the contribution of informal sector in generating employment and economic growth rather than focusing solely on exploitative labour conditions in these economic activities. Indeed, with the retreat of welfare state and the introduction of contract labour in the formal sector, many issues related to occupational hazards and improper labour conditions do not remain unique to the informal sectors of the economy, particularly in less developed countries. This volume addresses a specific concern: the issue of knowledge generation and innovative activities, which lies at the core of sustained competitive advantage of these activities.

Economics of Global Business,Rodrigo Zeidan,MIT Press,2018-11-13,"A textbook with innovative real-world macroeconomic analyses of timely policy issues, with case studies and examples from more than fifty countries. This timely and refreshingly real–world focused textbook examines some of the world's most critical policy issues through a macroeconomics lens. After presenting analytical foundations, modeling tools, and theoretical perspectives, Economics of Global Business goes a step further than most other texts, with a practical look at the local and multinational tradeoffs facing economic policymakers in more than fifty countries. Topics range from income equality and the financial crisis to GDP, inflation and unemployment, and, notably, one of the first macroeconomic examinations of climate change. Written by a globetrotting economist who teaches and consults on three continents, Economics of Global Business aims not for definitive answers but rather to provide a better understanding of the context-dependent rationales, constraints, and consequences of economic policy decisions. The book covers long-run and short-run growth (with examples from the United States, China, the European Union, South Korea, Japan, Latin America, Africa, Australia, and Vietnam); financial crises and central banks; monetary and fiscal policies; government budgets; currency regimes; climate change and macroeconomics; income inequality; and globalization.

Managerial Economics,Nick Wilkinson,Cambridge University Press,2022-01-13,"Managerial economics, meaning the application of economic methods in the managerial decision-making process, is a fundamental part of any business or management course. The current business environment presents managers with increasingly difficult decisions, amidst the Covid-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns, as well as the digital revolution and improved technology. Now in its second edition, this textbook features a new focus on how managerial economics has been transformed by the increasing importance of digitization within both the workplace and wider economy. It also features a new chapter on consumer theory, which emphasizes psychological factors and behavioural economics. Wilkinson adapts a user-friendly problem-solving approach to take the reader in gradual steps from simple problems through increasingly difficult material to complex case studies, demonstrating how to apply the principles of managerial economics to real-life situations. This book will be invaluable to business and economics students at both undergraduate and graduate levels.",1108996426,9781108996426,812,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=w9tXEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=w9tXEAAAQBAJ&dq=Business+Economics&hl=&cd=177&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=w9tXEAAAQBAJ&dq=Business+Economics&hl=&source=gbs_api

Mathematics for Economics and Business,Jean Soper,Wiley-Blackwell,1999,"Written for first-year undergraduates on economics and business courses, this book offers the ideal approach to understanding the mathematics relevant to them. It sets out all the basic mathematical techniques and explains the economic analysis or business context where each is used. By following the worked examples and tackling the practice problems, students will discover how to use and apply each of the techniques. The book is structured with mathematical methods and economics applications in separate sections. This allows students either first to learn the mathematics needed in a particular chapter or to proceed immediately to the economics examples, depending on their mathematical backgrounds. Although the book is complete in itself, it also encourages students to develop their understanding of both mathematics and economics by using the interactive screens on the ""MathEcon"" CD-ROM.

Socio-Political and Business Economics,Graeme Bedell,New Generation Publishing,2010-02,"From Canadian farmer's boy J K Galbraith to grocer's daughter Margaret Thatcher, Graeme Bedell presents a lightning study of the titans who strode the politico- economic stage in the West over the past 200 years. We move from Adam Smith and David Ricardo to Marx, Keynes and Beveridge, finally reaching the monetarist policies of Milton Friedman that found sharp expression in recent Tory governments. It was Professor Phillips and his famous curve models that paved the way for Thatcherite 'kill or cure' policies when she cleansed the Augean stables of 1970s Britain; then came the boom and bust cycles we are so familiar with today under New Labour. In a work packed with facts and referenced quotations, the voices of the great are cut with personal observations by the author, a former Politics teacher, who recalls the social and political style of each era using cues from film, song and television to remind us just how it was. This spiced-up textbook is an invaluable guide to economics for the student, the businessman or the consumer in the street.",1847487165,9781847487162,314,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LdtwRAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=LdtwRAAACAAJ&dq=Business+Economics&hl=&cd=214&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=LdtwRAAACAAJ&dq=Business+Economics&hl=&source=gbs_api
Economics and Corporate Strategy,C. J. Sutton,Cambridge University Press,1980-04-30,"This book, first published in 1980, discusses corporate strategy for those interested in applying economic analysis to business problems. Drawing on a wide range of economics and management literature, the book shows how an understanding of industrial economics can help in analysing strategic decisions. Furthermore, the author explains how a firm's development must be adapted to its environment, its history and the experience of its personnel. Other topics discussed include integration and diversity, the growing importance of multinational operations, the strategic role of mergers, and innovation.",0521296102,9780521296106,236,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GDKOzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=GDKOzgEACAAJ&dq=Business+Economics&hl=&cd=215&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=GDKOzgEACAAJ&dq=Business+Economics&hl=&source=gbs_api

Business economics is also known as Managerial Economics. Making decisions is an essential part of running a business. The process of selecting one course of action from among two or more potential alternatives is referred to as decision making. The availability of finite fundamental resources, like as money, land, labour, and management, which are capable of being put to a variety of different purposes, gives rise to the problem of choice. The book emphasises that business economics is a subfield of applied economics that investigates the financial, organisational, market-related, and environmental concerns that are confronted by firms. And spans a wide range of topics, including the idea of scarcity as well as product factors, distribution, and consumption.",9395936584,9789395936583,220,Study Aids,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XSS9EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=XSS9EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Business+Economics&hl=&cd=240&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=XSS9EAAAQBAJ&dq=Business+Economics&hl=&source=gbs_api

Entrepreneurship and Management in Forestry and Wood Processing,Franz Schmithüsen,N/A,2014,"Forestry has long been in a rather favourable position in offering a valuable raw material source in high demand. However, with rapidly changing end-user demands and cost competitiveness within the forest and wood chain as a whole, the industry is needing to adapt. Explaining entrepreneurial action as part of a chain of comprehensive value-added processes leads to a new perception of forest production and wood processing. This book applies the main concepts of modern managerial science to the world of forestry and is the perfect book for students studying forestry and wood processing, as well as entrepreneurs and managers within the sector. Topics are covered from an entrepreneurial perspective and include perspectives from accounting, finance, economics, supply chain management, marketing and strategy.",0415591015,9780415591010,0,Entrepreneurship,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=r-n-ugAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=r-n-ugAACAAJ&dq=Business+Economics&hl=&cd=468&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=r-n-ugAACAAJ&dq=Business+Economics&hl=&source=gbs_api

This accessible text is designed to help students help themselves excel in the course. The content is organized into two parts: (1) A Library of Elementary Functions (Chapters 1-2) and (2) Finite Mathematics (Chapters 3-11). The book's overall approach, refined by the authors' experience with large sections of college freshmen, addresses the challenges of teaching and learning when students' prerequisite knowledge varies greatly.

"The Business, Policy, and Economics of Neurosurgery","Richard P. Menger, MD, MPA, Christopher M. Storey, MD, PhD, Anil Nanda, MD, MPH",Lulu.com,2018-06-29,"The concept of this project is based on the premise that neurosurgeons are vital agents in the application of the American health care apparatus. They remain the true advocates for patients undergoing surgery for a neurological condition. Yet, the tenets of health care economics, health care policy, and the business of medicine remain largely debated within the context of politicians, policy experts, and administrators. This textbook will ease that gap. It will bring material generally absent from medical curricula into discussion. It will make potent features of health care economics, policy, and the business of practice digestible to clinical neurosurgeons in order to help them better treat their patients. The information provided in this text will also provide an excellent foundation for understanding the mechanics of running a neurosurgical practice. It simultaneously addresses career progression and opportunity evaluation.",1483485145,9781483485140,332,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8fVlDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=8fVlDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Business+Economics&hl=&cd=518&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=8fVlDwAAQBAJ&dq=Business+Economics&hl=&source=gbs_api

International Company Taxation,Ulrich Schreiber,Springer Science & Business Media,2013-01-30,"The book is written for students of business economics and tax law. It focuses on investment and financing decisions in cross-border situations. In particular, the book deals with: Legal structures of international company taxation, International double taxation, Source-based and residence-based income taxation, International investment and profit shifting, International corporate tax planning, International tax planning and European law, Harmonization of corporate taxation in the European Union, International tax planning and tax accounting. International tax law is designed to avoid international double taxation and to combat international tax avoidance. Nevertheless, companies investing in foreign countries may suffer from international double taxation of profits. On the other hand, these companies may also be able to exploit an international tax rate differential by means of cross-border tax planning. Ulrich Schreiber holds the chair of Business Administration and Business Taxation at the University of Mannheim. He serves as co-editor of Schmalenbachs Zeitschrift für betriebswirtschaftliche Forschung (zfbf) and Schmalenbach Business Review (sbr) and is affiliated with the Centre for European Economic Research (ZEW) as a research associate.

An Introduction to Behavioral Economics,"Nick Wilkinson, Matthias Klaes",Bloomsbury Publishing,2017-12-16,"The third edition of this successful textbook is a comprehensive, rigorous survey of the major topics in the field of behavioral economics. Building on the strengths of the second edition, it offers an up-to-date and critical examination of the latest literature, research, developments and debates in the field. Offering an inter-disciplinary approach, the authors incorporate psychology, evolutionary biology and neuroscience into the discussions. And, ultimately, they consider what it means to be 'rational', why we so often indulge in 'irrational' and self-harming behavior, and also why 'irrational' behavior can sometimes serve us well. A perfect book for economics students studying behavioural economics at higher undergraduate level or Master's level.

The Oxford Handbook of Local Competitiveness,"David B. Audretsch, Albert N. Link, Mary Lindenstein Walshok",Oxford University Press,2015-08-03,"The local levels of economies have felt the impact of technological change and globalization. These forces have triggered the need to understand the dynamic mechanisms that enable locales to respond to such changes. For example, the downsizing of traditional employers because of a major loss in market share due to new competitors, acquisition by global firms, or off-shoring of production or services was traditionally thought to be beyond the scope of powers of local policy makers, thinkers, and business leaders. In the world of practice, those concerned about the economic performance of place-city, region or state-are increasingly focused on how to adapt to these trends and leverage their existing resources to respond to these global challenges as a positive opportunity. The Oxford Handbook of Local Competitiveness brings together some of the leading minds in the fields of business, economics, and the social sciences to identify, articulate, and analyze what influences and shapes local competitiveness and what places can do to enhance their economic performance. The contributors to the Handbook provide a body of systematic analyses suggesting that the local context is a critical element of the forces that shape competitiveness. The challenges to generate and sustain economic performance vary across places, and the factors and conditions that either enhance or impede competiveness also are place-specific. Finally, the characteristics and nature of what constitutes success also vary across places. This Handbook is essential reading material for academics in the fields of economics and public policy, as well as business leaders who hope to gain a more in-depth understanding of their field. Informative and intellectually rigorous, The Oxford Handbook of Local Competitiveness is the definitive volume of scholarly analysis regarding the relationship between place and economic competition.",0199993319,9780199993314,529,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2Hn5CQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=2Hn5CQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Business+Economics&hl=&cd=548&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2Hn5CQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Utility of Crowdsourcing for the Evaluation of Business Ideas and Their Market Potential in the Context of Creation of a Business Plan,Martin Pruschkowski,N/A,2018-07-10,"Master's Thesis from the year 2016 in the subject Business economics - Miscellaneous, University of applied sciences, Nürnberg, language: English, abstract: If candidates in the TV show ""Who wants to be a Millionaire?"" no longer know what to do, they often seek help at the phone joker. In the supposed experts, most players see the best advisers. But only in 54 percent of cases the responses of the phone joker is correct. This is still more than a 50:50 joker. However the much better choice is the audience joker. This joker has an average success rate of about 90 percent regardless of the time of its use. Therefore it is the best joker of all by using the collective distributed knowledge of people. That demonstrates that the participation of the crowd usually leads to a better result because the average of many independent judgments is often very close to the truth. Several years ago the sociologist James Surowiecki described this phenomenon in his international bestseller ""The Wisdom of the Crowds"" and demonstrated with many examples that a group can find better solutions and make more intelligent decisions than individuals. He justified this on one hand with the fact that individuals are often guided by feelings, on the other hand that they have limited information and consequently only a limited view. Because of self-organizing, statistical effects (e.g. law of large numbers) and the fact that the crowd is not limited to bureaucracy, administration, time or location the crowd can surpass every individual expert. Crowdsourcing, the next step in the evolution of outsourcing can activate the wisdom of the crowd by using the collective intelligence of a large number of individuals from cognitively diverse perspectives. For instance the web-based encyclopedia Wikipedia, the web browser Firefox or the operating system Linux rely on the participation and collective knowledge of the crowd.

The Role of Multi-Purpose Cooperatives in the Economic Development,Desalegn Fekadu Etefa,GRIN Verlag,2019-12-16,"Case Study from the year 2019 in the subject Business economics - General, grade: -, , course: Business, language: English, abstract: The objective of this study is to show the overall development trends and the challenges encountering the multi-purpose cooperatives (MPCs). To do so, research methodology employed was descriptive, which involved both qualitative and quantitative methods. Data were collected from both primary and secondary sources. Data were collected from the sample through cross-sectional survey from 210 respondents. Besides, 16 key informants and three FGDs were considered in the assessment. The instruments used were questionnaires, FGDs, in depth interviews, observation and document review. Both probability and non-probability sampling techniques were applied. Data analyses were done using descriptive statistics. The result of the study shows that the average rate of growth of members in sample MPCs is 19% as calculated from 2016-2018 and 79.3% from their formation period. The capital of the sample MPCs increased from 305,081 to 9.3 million and their profit was nearly 1.5 million ETB. Of the multifaceted services they provide, marketing agricultural inputs accounts for the great proportions. In general, the sample MPCs are contributing somewhat to the economic development of the MPCs. However, their performance is not as expected due to major problems identified: lack of professional managers, devoted management committees, limited capital base; weak horizontal and vertical linkages, low members’ participation, insufficient dividend, lack of diversified activities; limited awareness, inadequate infrastructure, low stakeholders’ participation, lack of adequate credit facilities and other necessary technical supports are among hitches to be tackled.",3346083322,9783346083326,93,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XnnEDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=XnnEDwAAQBAJ&dq=Business+Economics&hl=&cd=562&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=XnnEDwAAQBAJ&dq=Business+Economics&hl=&source=gbs_api

Destroying Islamic State Finance. An Examination of the Main Economic Sanctions Against the Terrorist Organisation,Mark Barnes,GRIN Verlag,2016-08-10,"Essay from the year 2016 in the subject Business economics - Investment and Finance, grade: A-, , course: International Relations, State, and Strategy, language: English, abstract: Recent news surrounding the battles in Iraq and Syria give the impression that the Islamic State is losing many of their important gains and will eventually succumb. This, however, is not the time to withdraw the pressure from the Islamic State. They still have a vast arrange of ways of collecting money from a variety of financial sources. The international community has to keep the pressure not just on the battlefield but also on the banks and assets that the Islamic State has managed to get a hold of. It is well documented how the Islamic State was able to take and contain hold of significant amount of territories in Iraq and Syria. The failures of the Iraqi government and the uprising against the Syrian government helped lead to Islamic State victories on the battlefield. Before those battles even began, though, there was a significant amount of financial and material resources in the hands of the Islamic State. This paper identifies how the Islamic State gets its revenues, examines the main economic sanctions that have taken place against the terrorist organization, then goes through their individual sources of revenue and analyzes what has been done and what more the international community can do in order to stop the Islamic State from taking in such large amounts of money.",3668272670,9783668272675,17,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LX6SDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=LX6SDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Business+Economics&hl=&cd=564&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=LX6SDQAAQBAJ&dq=Business+Economics&hl=&source=gbs_api

Human capital is a carrying pillar within every hospitality business. Employees have to be motivated to increase the customer satisfaction and ensure the economical aims of the enterprise. While the enquiry for the balance between social life and work has been recognized by various industries, the hospitality industry seems backward regarding the implementation of Work-Life Balance, later in the text also abbreviated as WLB, methods. Hospitality businesses have to realize, that the success of the business is no longer just based on natural conditions or advantages of the location or special tourism activities within a destination.

The dimension of vulnerability has taken on great importance after the recent events of the COVID-19 pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine. Events have demonstrated how, in a short time, a stable scenario can change to jeopardize the entire estate of complex systems. These events also revealed how quickly a threat could spread worldwide.
