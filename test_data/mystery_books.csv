The Mystery and the World,Maria Clara Bingemer,Wipf and Stock Publishers,2016-05-10,"During the past century, an enormous effervescence of events changed the sociopolitical configuration of the world. The interpretation of these facts helped further deepen the crisis in which modern thought already found itself--and it generated the uncertain and unstable environment in which we live today, the so-called postmodernity, late modernity, or hypermodernity. In this context, one of the most profound impacts is most certainly the one on religion. During the twentieth century, religion proved not to be banished from the human horizon as the masters of suspicion intended. Known as the godless century, the twentieth century saw also a resuscitation of the search for the sense of life and spirituality. With the crisis of modern reason, humankind turned toward consumerism and provisional and ""light"" practices. The last century represents not only the height of the postmodernization process but also the rescue of the transcendent and absolute, even if it is an absolute without face and identity. It is in this scenario that religious experiences, apparently exiled by modern rationality, begin to occur and multiply again. Mystical experiences will be, then, the basis for highlighting recurrent characteristics with universal import. But they will show a different configuration than before. One will be able to find them not in so-called sacred spaces but in very secular ones; not so much within institutions but at the borders, or even outside them; not configured by a specific tradition but in an interface that makes more than one tradition meet and dialogue.",1498276334,9781498276337,401,Religion,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5kxQDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=5kxQDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT215&dq=mystery&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5kxQDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Eudora Welty and Mystery,"Jacob Agner, Harriet Pollack",Univ. Press of Mississippi,2022-12-28,"Contributions by Jacob Agner, Sarah Gilbreath Ford, Katie Berry Frye, Michael Kreyling, Andrew B. Leiter, Rebecca Mark, Suzanne Marrs, Tom Nolan, Michael Pickard, Harriet Pollack, and Victoria Richard Eudora Welty’s ingenious play with readers’ expectations made her a cunning writer, a paramount modernist, a short story artist of the first rank, and a remarkable literary innovator. In her signature puzzle-texts, she habitually engages with familiar genres and then delights readers with her transformations and nonfulfillment of conventions. Eudora Welty and Mystery: Hidden in Plain Sight reveals how often that play is with mystery, crime, and detective fiction genres, popular fiction forms often condescended to in literary studies, but unabashedly beloved by Welty throughout her lifetime. Put another way, Welty often creates her stories’ secrets by both evoking and displacing crime fiction conventions. Instead of restoring order with a culminating reveal, her story-puzzles characteristically allow mystery to linger and thicken. The mystery pursued becomes mystery elsewhere. The essays in this collection shift attention from narratives, characters, and plots as they have previously been understood by unearthing enigmas hidden within those constructions. Some of these new readings continue Welty’s investigation of hegemonic whiteness and southern narratives of race—outlining these in chalk as outright crime stories. Other essays show how Welty anticipated the regendering of the form now so characteristic of contemporary women mystery writers. Her tender and widely ranging personal correspondence with the hard-boiled American crime writer Ross Macdonald is also discussed. Together these essays make the case that across her career, Eudora Welty was arguably one of the genre’s greatest double agents, and, to apply the titles of Macdonald’s novels to her inventiveness with the form, she is its “underground woman,” its unexpected “sleeping beauty.”",1496842723,9781496842725,165,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=a3ufEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=a3ufEAAAQBAJ&pg=PT7&dq=mystery&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=a3ufEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Human Sexuality and the Nuptial Mystery,Roy R. Jeal,Wipf and Stock Publishers,2010-03-08,"This collection of essays was originally presented at the St. Margaret's Consultation on Doctrine, Liturgy, and Preaching held at St. Margaret's Anglican Church in Winnipeg, Canada in 2008. They consider human sexuality and marriage from a distinctly theological rather than polemical standpoint, aiming to avoid frequently polarized debates. The interesting commonality indicated in the articles is that sex and marriage are not about self-fulfillment, but are outwardly directed, aimed toward the other person, toward growth, maturity, and deepened spirituality, for the benefit of the church, for productive good, and for children. The first section explores theological and ethical issues surrounding human sexuality and aims toward understanding the nature of relationships in these contexts. The second section explores the spiritual nature of marriage and the history of thinking on marriage and family within Christian theology. For those interested in pursuing truly theological engagement with marriage and sexuality, this collection is required reading.",1621890880,9781621890881,161,Religion,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HH9JAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=HH9JAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT93&dq=mystery&hl=&cd=11&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HH9JAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

The Mystery of Musical Creativity,Hermann Beckh,Temple Lodge Publishing,2019-11-06,"‘Beckh ventures into provinces that I have not had the opportunity of investigating myself…’ – Rudolf Steiner Lost for decades, the manuscript of Hermann Beckh’s final lectures on the subject of music present fundamentally new insights into its cosmic origins. Beckh characterises the qualities of musical development, examines select musical works (that represent for him the peak of human ingenuity), and throws new light on the nature and source of human creativity and inspiration. Published here for the first time, the lectures demonstrate a distinctive approach founded on the raw material of musical perception. Beckh discusses the whistling wind, the billowing wave, the song of the birds and particularly the theme of longing. Never losing the ground from under his feet, he penetrates perennial themes: from the yearning for real spontaneity and the ‘Mystery background’ uniting heaven and earth, to spiritual knowledge that can meet the demands of the twenty-first century. Out of the cosmic context, Beckh writes to the individual situation. From there, he seeks again the re-won cosmic context. He does not write as a musical specialist and then turn to universal human concerns; rather, Beckh writes from universal human concerns and reveals music as of special concern to everyone. In addition to the transcripts of fifteen lectures, this book contains a valuable introduction and editorial footnotes. It also features appendices including Beckh’s essay ‘The Mystery of the Night in Wagner and Novalis’; reminiscences of Beckh by August Pauli and Harro Rückner; Donald Francis Tovey’s ‘Wagnerian harmony and the evolution of the Tristan-chord’, and several contemporaneous reviews of Beckh’s published works.",1912230380,9781912230389,190,Music,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Shu7DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=Shu7DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA118&dq=mystery&hl=&cd=29&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=Shu7DwAAQBAJ&dq=mystery&hl=&source=gbs_api

When Eliza’s brother finds himself thrust into the center of a scandal—and murder—that threatens to bring down Eliza’s family and all of Thistlewood, the Montagu’s last hope lies in Eliza’s detective skills. Can Eliza unearth something the local authorities may have overlooked? Or will this mean the end of her family as she knew it?

This bundle offers books #7, #8 and #9 in one convenient file, with over 200,000 words of reading. In ONCE FORSAKEN, when Special Agent Riley Paige finally decides to take a well-needed rest from the FBI, a request for help comes from the most unlikely source: her own daughter. April’s best friend is devastated by the death of her sister, a freshman at Georgetown. Worse, she is convinced that the suicide was staged, and that her sister was murdered at the hands of a serial killer. Riley reluctantly looks into the case, only to discover that two other freshman girls at Georgetown recently killed themselves in the same grotesque way—by hanging. As she realizes foul play may be afoot, she brings in the FBI. The case takes Riley deep into the privileged campus of one of the world’s most esteemed universities, into the unsettling world of the wealthy and driven families that pushed their children to succeed. In time she discovers that this case is far more twisted than it seems—and that she just may be up against the most psychotic killer of her career. In ONCE COLD, there is one cold case that has plagued Special Agent Riley Paige for her entire career, dwelling at the corners of her consciousness, forcing her to return to it again and again. The only case she has never solved, she has finally put it out of her mind. Until she gets a call from the murdered victim’s mother. It spurs Riley to face the case once again, and to not give up until she has found answers. Yet Riley barely has time to catch her breath when she receives a lead for another cold case, one which, if possible, strikes an even deeper note within her. It is a lead that promises to solve the case of her own mother’s killer. In ONCE STALKED, when two soldiers are found dead on a huge military base in California, apparently killed by gunshot, military investigators are stumped. Who is killing its soldiers, inside the secure confines of its own base? And why? The FBI is called in, and Riley Paige is summoned to take the lead. As Riley finds herself immersed in the military culture, she is amazed to realize that serial killers can strike even here, in the midst of the most secure location on earth. She finds herself in a frantic cat and mouse chase, racing to decode the killer’s psychology. Yet she soon discovers she is up against a highly-trained killer, one that may, even for her, be too deadly an opponent. Dark psychological thrillers with heart-pounding suspense, the Riley Paige mysteries are a riveting new series—with a beloved new character—that will leave you turning pages late into the night.",1640291687,9781640291683,951,Fiction,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HBkwDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=HBkwDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT303&dq=mystery&hl=&cd=42&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HBkwDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

"The ""Mystery of History"", its Functionalisation and Disintegration in Graham Swift’s ""Waterland""",Thorben Höppner,GRIN Verlag,2023-05-02,"Seminar paper from the year 2021 in the subject English Language and Literature Studies - Literature, grade: 1,0, , language: English, abstract: This paper investigates how the ambivalent, perhaps even ambiguous definition of ‘historia’ relates to the representation of history in the novel and how this representation again relates to its functionalisation by Tom Crick. To answer this question, this paper will primarily work with Linda Hutcheon’s notion of ‘historiographic metafiction’ while also pointing out similarities to the reading of Waterland as a trauma narrative. In taking a closer look at the protagonist-narrator himself, this paper argues that the protection “from chaos and disorder”, which Landow addresses, is only achieved through a form of historical escapism. Superficially speaking, Graham Swift’s Waterland is a novel about a history teacher who, having lost his job, forsakes the formal teaching of history, and embarks on an extracurricular journey into his own past. However, upon closer examination, Waterland is more than that, a novel about history itself. It explores “the whole mystery of ‘history’”, as Swift himself puts it in the introduction to the novel (Waterland, xv). Thus, it is only logical that the novel prefaces its narrative with an insightful epigraph: a dictionary definition of the Latin word ‘historia’, from which the English word ‘history’ originates. As can be seen above, however, said definition is ambivalent- it is “inherently polysemantic” as Judith Ryan notes. James Acheson has likewise pointed out that the fact that “historia can mean either history or fiction is significant, for the historian and the writer of fiction must deal with similar problems in writing about the past”. The natural tendency of language towards proliferation of its meaning aside, the epigraph leaves us with a very ambivalent concept of history, which the narrative of Waterland, in its dealing with history, then builds on. Since such a prominent theme in Waterland, the novel’s representation of history has been thoroughly examined in secondary literature; particularly against the theoretical background of what Linda Hutcheon has identified as ‘historiographic metafiction’.",3346864774,9783346864772,20,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ysq8EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=ysq8EAAAQBAJ&pg=PA3&dq=mystery&hl=&cd=71&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=ysq8EAAAQBAJ&dq=mystery&hl=&source=gbs_api
Chasing Mystery,Carey Walsh,Liturgical Press,2012-11-01,"Why does God have to be so exasperatingly silent? Why can't we see him at least long enough to allay doubt? How does one grow deeper in love with God against the cultural currents of disdain and antagonism? Chasing Mystery is an exploration into how the Bible negotiates the presence and absence of God in the hopes of forging a path in situations where absences often seem more pressing than presences. Amid the prevailing skepticism and restlessness, says Walsh, we must relearn the skill of trust in reading Scripture. The aim is to experience God through holy writing. Walsh offers a work in biblical theology that explores the liveliness of the God of the Bible. She insists that the pages of the Bible do not simply describe divine presence; they evoke it in the process of reading. Not all the time, certainly not predictably, but enough to warrant a trust. Her goal is to strengthen the heart's reading competency in order to facilitate our encounter with God.",0814680941,9780814680940,177,Religion,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7COT9RKz6mAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=7COT9RKz6mAC&pg=PA33&dq=mystery&hl=&cd=72&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=7COT9RKz6mAC&dq=mystery&hl=&source=gbs_api

"Magic, Mystery, and Science","Dan Burton, David Grandy",N/A,2004,"Magic, Mystery, and Science presents the occult as a ""third stream"" of belief, as important to the shaping of Western civilization as Greek rationalism or Judeo-Christianity. The occult seeks explanations in a world that is living and intelligent--quite unlike the one supposed by science. By taking these beliefs seriously, while keeping an eye on science, this book aims to capture some of the power of the occult. Readers will discover that the occult has a long history that reaches back to Babylonia and ancient Egypt. It proceeds alongside, and frequently mingles with, religion and science.

"OMG (Oh My God), A CUL8R Time Travel Mystery/Romance",Bob Kat,Nightwriter93,2012-11-29,"OMG [Oh My God], Book #1 of the CUL8R Time Travel Mystery/Romance series. Change the past, Save the future. Three high school friends are able to do two things no one else on the planet can do . . . talk with dead people and time travel to the past. For Kelly, it’s a major adjustment to move from the only life she has ever known in Texas to live with her aunt in Ft. Myers Beach, Florida. She quickly makes friends with her quirky next door neighbor, Scott and his best friend, Austin. In her aunt’s garage, they find a long-lost invention of Thomas Edison called “The Telephone to the Dead”. Edison had abandoned the project and given it to Kelly’s great-great-grandfather. Scott tinkers with it until they can hear sounds coming from it. But instead of broadcasting music . . . it picks up conversations from the dead. As they slowly turn the dial they hear hundreds of sad, lonely voices of souls that have passed but apparently never moved on, pleading for help. A teenager’s voice separates from the rest and begs for their help to clear her reputation. They are shocked to find out that she had gone to their own high school . . . 47 years ago. They research the girl’s story and discover that her name was Wendy and she had been a popular cheerleader who had apparently committed suicide. The teens are touched by Wendy’s cries and pleas, but they have no way to go back in time to help her. That is, until Scott reveals an nvention of his own . . . a time travel app. Kelly and Austin are very skeptical. Even Scott isn’t sure it will work, so they try it out on his sister’s pet turtle. Amazingly, the turtle disappears. But did it travel to the past or just wander off? Finally, they decide to humor Scott and go along with his claims of time travel. They meet on the beach after everyone else has gone home. They stand in the formation Scott insists will create the perfect vortex for time travel. At the last moment, a fourth person runs forward and is pulled into their adventure back to 1966. They figure out a way to get close to Wendy without her asking too many questions that they can’t answer. But as they discover the secret to her death, they find it’s not as clear-cut as it would seem. A romance gone wrong, an over-attentive teacher and a young girl’s dreams for the future are all twisted into a mystery that causes the teens to take greater risks than they could have imagined. It all becomes very real when their own lives are in danger and they realize they may never make it back to the present. OMG – Winner of the Best Indie Book of 2013 for Young Adults and Finalist in the 2013 Beverly Hills Book Awards. Well plotted and fast paced. Martha Bryce The best time travel novel I've read yet, and I hope there's more to come. A big thumbs up! C WOW! I've been thinking about that book for a week now since I finished reading it.

'I ask you,' retorted Jasper, 'because you were the last person in his company, and he is not to be found.' The Mystery of Edwin Drood, Dickens's last novel, lay unfinished at his death. Speculation remains rife as to its probably conclusion; evidence suggests that, fascinated as Dickens was by details of the plotting, his basic concern was for character and appropriate setting, in particular the character of the hero-villain, Jasper. The ancient city of Cloisterham, its cathedral a reminder of mortality, human frailty, and the lawful life, is an effective background for what Dickens daughter called a tale of 'the tragic secrets of the human heart'. Humour is provided by a host of characters ranging fro Mr Grewgious, the admirable though eccentric lawyer, and Miss Twinkleton, guardian of the Young Ladies' Seminary, to Durdles, the hard-drinking stonemason, and Deputy, the irreverent lodging-house boy. This edition contains Dickens's working plans for the novel, and the text is that of the authoritative Clarendon edition.

An Act of Villainy is an a gem, set in 1930s London and filled with style, banter, and twists that traditional mystery fans will positively relish. ""So you've gotten yourself involved with another murder, have you?"" Walking through London’s West End after a night at the theater, Amory Ames and her husband Milo run into wealthy investor and former actor Gerard Holloway. Holloway and his wife Georgina are old friends of theirs, and when Holloway invites them to the dress rehearsal of a new play he is directing, Amory readily accepts. However, Amory is shocked to learn that Holloway has cast his mistress, actress Flora Bell, in the lead role. Furthermore, the casual invitation is not what it seems—he admits to Amory and Milo that Flora has been receiving threatening letters, and he needs their help in finding the mysterious sender. Despite Amory’s conflicting feelings—not only does she feel loyalty to Georgina, but the disintegration of the Holloways’ perfect marriage seems to bode ill for her own sometimes delicate relationship—her curiosity gets the better of her, and she begins to make inquiries. It quickly becomes clear that each member of the cast has reason to resent Flora—and with a group so skilled in the art of deception, it isn’t easy to separate truth from illusion. When vague threats escalate, the scene is set for murder, and Amory and Milo must find the killer before the final curtain falls.

Her name is Sylvia Rule, and she demands to know why Poirot has accused her of the murder of Barnabas Pandy, a man she has neither heard of nor ever met. She is furious to be so accused, and deeply shocked. Poirot is equally shocked, because he too has never heard of any Barnabas Pandy, and he certainly did not send the letter in question. He cannot convince Sylvia Rule of his innocence, however, and she marches away in a rage. Shaken, Poirot goes inside, only to find that he has a visitor waiting for him — a man called John McCrodden who also claims also to have received a letter from Poirot that morning, accusing him of the murder of Barnabas Pandy...

Down the Hatch,"M. C. Beaton, R.W. Green",Minotaur Books,2021-10-26,"Beloved New York Times bestseller M. C. Beaton's cranky, crafty Agatha Raisin—the star of her own hit T.V. series—is back on the case again in Down the Hatch. Private detective Agatha Raisin, having recently taken up power-walking, is striding along a path in Mircester Park during her lunch break when she hears a cry for help. Rushing over, she finds an elderly couple, Mr. and Mrs. Swinburn, in the middle of the green—with the body of an old man lying at their feet. The man, who the coroner determines died by poisoning, was known as ""the Admiral,"" a gardener notorious for his heavy drinking, and Chief Inspector Wilkes writes the death off as an accident caused by the consumption of weedkiller stored in a rum bottle. Agatha is not convinced that anyone would mistake weedkiller for rum but carries on with her work at Raisin Investigations, until she receives an anonymous tip that the Admiral’s death was no accident. Local gossip points to the Swinburns themselves as the killers, spurred by a feud at the club where they, as well as the Admiral, were members.

Kissing Christmas Goodbye,M. C. Beaton,Minotaur Books,2007-10-02,"Kissing Christmas Goodbye continues the tradition in M. C. Beaton's beloved Agatha Raisin mystery cozy series—now a hit show on Acorn TV and public television. Unlike quite a number of people, Agatha had not given up on Christmas. To have the perfect Christmas had been a childhood dream whilst surviving a rough upbringing in a Birmingham slum. Holly berries glistened, snow fell gently outside, and inside, all was Dickensian jollity. And in her dreams, James Lacey kissed her under the mistletoe, and, like a middle-aged sleeping beauty, she would awake to passion once more.... Agatha Raisin is bored. Her detective agency in the Cotswolds is thriving, but she'll scream if she has to deal with another missing cat or dog. Only two things seem to offer potential excitement: the upcoming Christmas festivities and her ex, James Lacey. This year she is sure that if she invites James to a really splendid, old-fashioned Christmas dinner, their love will rekindle like a warm Yule log. When a wealthy widow hires Agatha because she's convinced a member of her family is trying to kill her, Agatha is intrigued---especially when the widow drops dead after high tea at the manor house. Who in this rather sterile house, complete with fake family portraits, could have hated the old lady enough to poison her? Agatha sets out to find the murderer, all the while managing a pretty, teenage trainee who makes her feel old and planning for a picture-perfect Christmas, with James, all the trimmings, and perhaps even snow.",1429920289,9781429920285,260,Fiction,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=e5I-3_iukakC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=e5I-3_iukakC&printsec=frontcover&dq=mystery&hl=&cd=192&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=e5I-3_iukakC&source=gbs_api

"Mystery Women, Volume Three (Revised)",Colleen Barnett,Poisoned Pen Press,2011-05-27,"An Encyclopedia of Leading Women Characters in Mystery Fiction, Volume 3: (1990-1999)Like other fictional characters, female sleuths may live in the past or the future. They may represent current times with some level of reality or shape their settings to suit an agenda. There are audiences for both realism and escapism in the mystery novel. It is interesting, however, to compare the fictional world of the mystery sleuth with the world in which readers live. Of course, mystery readers do not share one simplistic world. They live in urban, suburban, and rural areas, as do the female heroines in the books they read. They may choose a book because it has a familiar background or because it takes them to places they long to visit. Readers may be rich or poor; young or old; conservative or liberal. So are the heroines. What incredible choices there are today in mystery series! This three-volume encyclopedia of women characters in the mystery novel is like a gigantic menu. Like a menu, the descriptions of the items that are provided are subjective. Volume 3 of Mystery Women as currently updated adds an additional 42 sleuths to the 500 plus who were covered in the initial Volume 3. These are more recently discovered sleuths who were introduced during the period from January 1, 1990 to December 31, 1999. This more than doubles the number of sleuths introduced in the 1980s (298 of whom were covered in Volume 2) and easily exceeded the 347 series (and some outstanding individuals) described in Volume 1, which covered a 130-year period from 1860-1979.

The Daffodil Mystery,Edgar Wallace,DigiCat,2022-11-22,"In 'The Daffodil Mystery,' Edgar Wallace weaves a gripping narrative that melds the conventions of the thriller genre with a keen exploration of social injustices. The prose, markedly clear-cut and driving, hurtles the reader through the twists and turmoils of Odette Rider's life after her wrongful dismissal from Lyne Stores. Wallace employs a remarkable literary style that is both laconic and elaborate, illustrating the stark class and gender dichotomies of early 20th-century England. Set against the backdrop of a society grappling with the burgeoning issues of workplace harassment and inequality, Wallace's novel remains a pertinent testimonial to the era's zeitgeist, conducted through the mechanism of compelling detective fiction. Edgar Wallace's prolific career as a writer is often characterized by an in-depth understanding of the criminal undercurrents of London's society, which arguably shapes the authenticity of 'The Daffodil Mystery.' His experience as a war correspondent and a crime reporter lends an intricate realism to the characters' psychology and the novel's societal critique. It is speculated that Wallace's own observations and experiences may have prompted him to write a novel as socially aware as this, implicating a personal undertone to his thrilling narration. 'The Daffodil Mystery' is recommended for readers who revel in the complexities of a classic whodunit while appreciating a narrative that courageously challenges socio-economic and gender norms. Wallace, with his astute skill in creating suspense and constructing intricate plots, ensures that this novel transcends mere entertainment, providing instead a compelling discourse on morality and justice. As much as it is a page-turner, it serves as a mirror to the societal reflections that continue to resonate in our present times, making it a timeless piece in the thriller genre.",N/A,N/A,219,Fiction,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CsijEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=CsijEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=mystery&hl=&cd=202&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=CsijEAAAQBAJ&dq=mystery&hl=&source=gbs_api
The Witch's Tongue: A Charlie Moon Mystery,James D. Doss,Minotaur Books,2007-04-01,"Strange things are happening near Granite Creek, Colorado, all in the space of less than twenty-four hours. A Ute shaman dreams of being buried alive and hears the hooting of an owl, signaling impending death. A man walks into Spirit Canyon and disappears, leaving his battered wife both relieved and devastated. A private museum is burgled. An Apache is arrested for assaulting a police officer. And a sniper takes a shot through an antique store window, wounding the proprietor. Part-time Ute tribal investigator Charlie Moon would rather be tending to his duties on the Columbine Ranch than playing detective with this puzzling collection of seemingly unrelated events.

In The Witch's Tongue, James D.

The wildflowers decorating her hair scatter across the grass in the sharp breeze. Her lips are parted slightly, as if to whisper goodnight for the very last time… When twelve-year-old Holly Mitchell’s fragile little body is found on the steps of a mountainside church in the small town of Denton, a doll made from pine cones clasped tightly to her chest, Detective Josie Quinn rushes to attend the scene. She knows this little girl’s angelic face, her mother had offered Josie help when she’d needed it most. Searching the girl’s house, Josie is devastated to find that Holly’s mother is dead too, and her little sister is missing. But why has this family home been stripped of all sharp objects? Re-tracing her steps, Josie finally finds a secret hiding place with Holly’s sister inside, terrified, but alive. Moments later, another doll made of twigs turns up. Certain the killer is close by, Josie holds the little girl tight and tries to coax answers from her, but it’s clear the pile of burnt photographs and letters found in the greenhouse is her only lead. No one is safe until Josie can figure out the dangerous secret that has escaped this remote family home. Just when Josie is finally closing in on the killer, the unthinkable happens, a tragedy that shakes her to her very core. And on the windshield of her car: a third wooden doll.

Death on the Prowl,Ann Granger,Hachette UK,2024-12-05,"The eighth Campbell and Carter mystery from much-loved crime writer Ann Granger is sure to appeal to fans of her Mitchell and Markby mysteries, as well as to fans of Richard Osman's The Thursday Murder Club series. When Jerry Harrison receives an unwelcome visitor at his remote Cotswold cottage one winter's night, the last thing he expects is to end up dead. But, next morning, his cleaners find him fatally stabbed and the police have a murder inquiry on their hands. At first, Inspector Jess Campbell and Superintendent Ian Carter aren't sure of the victim's identity, but it's not long before a neighbour, Eleanor Holder, comes forward with her opinions on the deceased. Jerry Harrison was not a popular man in the village of Weston St Ambrose; his aunt's tragic death led to him inheriting her cottage and many of the locals still see him as an outsider. With no witnesses coming forward and very little evidence to go on, Jess and Ian must dig deep to find the answers to this baffling case. But not before another villager is attacked and left for dead . . .

The Mystery of Edwin Drood,Charles Dickens,Independently Published,2021-04-02,"Charles Dickens's final, unfinished novel, and one that has puzzled readers and inspired writers since its publication, The Mystery of Edwin Drood is edited with an introduction by David Paroissien in Penguin Classics. Edwin Drood is contracted to marry orphan Rosa Bud when he comes of age, but when they find that duty has gradually replaced affection, they agree to break off the engagement. Shortly afterwards, in the middle of a storm on Christmas Eve, Edwin disappears, leaving nothing behind but some personal belongings and the suspicion that his jealous uncle John Jasper, madly in love with Rosa, is the killer. And beyond this presumed crime there are further intrigues: the dark opium dens of the sleepy cathedral town of Cloisterham, and the sinister double life of Choirmaster Jasper, whose drug-fuelled fantasy life belies his respectable appearance.

John Dee's Five Books of Mystery,N/A,Weiser Books,2002-02-15,"Discovered in a hidden compartment of an old chest long after his death, the secret writings of John Dee, one of the leading scientists and occultists of Elizabethan England, record in minute detail his research into the occult. Dee concealed his treatises on the nature of humankind's contact with angelic realms and languages throughout his life, and they were nearly lost forever. In his brief biography of John Dee, Joseph Peterson calls him a ""true Renaissance man"" -- detailing his work in astronomy, mathematics, navigation, the arts, astrology, and the occult sciences. He was even thought to be the model for Shakespeare's Prospero. All this was preparation for Dee's main achievement: five books, revealed and transcribed between March 1582 and May 1583, bringing to light mysteries and truths that scholars and adepts have been struggling to understand and use ever since. These books detail his system for communicating with the angels, and reveal that the angels were interested in and involved with the exploration and colonization of the New World, and in heralding in a new age or new world order. While Dee's influence was certainly felt in his lifetime, his popularity has grown tremendously since. His system was used and adapted by the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, and subsequently by Aleister Crowley. This new edition of John Dee's Five Books of Mystery is by far the most accessible and complete published to date. Peterson has translated Latin terms and added copious footnotes, putting the instructions and references into context for the modern reader.",1609255720,9781609255725,500,"Body, Mind & Spirit",en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6eBoF-P7h-oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=6eBoF-P7h-oC&printsec=frontcover&dq=mystery&hl=&cd=237&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6eBoF-P7h-oC&source=gbs_api

Tool & Die,Sarah Graves,Bantam,2004-12-28,"Jacobia “Jake” Tiptree traded her power-broker life for a run-down dream house in peaceful Eastport, Maine. But the do-it-yourself enthusiast is learning that no matter how carefully you build your home, murder has a way of slipping in through the cracks. . . . It’s a bright June afternoon and old-house-fixer-upper Jake Tiptree is driving through downeast Maine on an unusual errand. She’s getting ready to interview a large, angry man with a criminal history. Jim Diamond may or may not be harassing his ex-wife with life-threatening letters, but Jake promised her new housekeeper, Bella Diamond, she’d look into the matter. An ex-con and a deadbeat, Jim Diamond doesn’t have a history of violence . . . that is, not until Jake arrives at his apartment and discovers that a killer has been there first. Suddenly Jake and her best friend, Ellie White, find themselves at the center of a murder with too many suspects and too few clues. And as if that’s not enough, Jake is now saddled with the manic Bella, whose certainty that she’ll be the next victim is fueling a supercompulsive neatness—one that threatens to clean Jake and her long-suffering husband, Wade, out of house and home. Add to that a moose in her kitchen, a rebellious son with a habit of dumping Miss Right for Miss Wrong, and a troublesome ex of her own, and Jake is already at wit’s end. Then she gets word that a horde of her dad’s long-lost relatives mean to descend on Eastport, intending to be put up at her far-from-fixed-up fixer-upper. When the killer does strike again, it’s not where Jake expects . . . and the victim couldn’t be more of a surprise. For this is a case bigger than the usual angry—ex-spouse variety, and now that Jake and Ellie have gotten themselves involved, they’ve each won a special place in a ruthless murderer’s master plan of greed, deception, and death. And the prize? A pair of eternally private rooms—six feet under!",0553901141,9780553901146,262,Fiction,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bGOggdmyoxoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=bGOggdmyoxoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=mystery&hl=&cd=271&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bGOggdmyoxoC&source=gbs_api

The Mystery of a Hansom Cab,Fergus W Hume,Robert W Strugnell,2017-03-19,"""The Mystery of a Hansom Cab"" takes place in Melbourne, Australia and involves an investigation into a homicide, after a corpse is discovered in the evening, in a hansom cab. The city of Melbourne plays a significant role in the plot and, as the author describes: ""Over all the great city hung a cloud of smoke like a pall."" The killer's identity is not as significant a revelation in the story as are the roles of the influential and secretive Frettlby family, and their secret: they have an illegitimate daughter living on the streets. The class divide between Melbourne's wealthy and less fortunate is addressed throughout the plot. The protagonist in the novel is a policeman named Detective Gorby, who is given the task of solving the murder. As Hume describes the character's investigative skills: ""He looked keenly round the room, and his estimate of the dead man's character was formed at once."" The author commented in a later introduction, ""All of the scenes in the book, especially the slums, are described from personal observation; and I passed a great many nights in Little Bourke Street, gathering material."" At this time, the street had gained notoriety as a place frequented by prostitutes and criminals.",099543302X,9780995433021,N/A,N/A,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=T9MWtAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=T9MWtAEACAAJ&dq=mystery&hl=&cd=295&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=T9MWtAEACAAJ&dq=mystery&hl=&source=gbs_api

The Czar's Spy,William Le Queux,Mint Editions,2021-08-10,"The Czar's Spy: The Mystery of Silent Love (1905) is an espionage adventure novel by Anglo-French writer William Le Queux. Published at the beginning of Le Queux's career as a leading author of popular thrillers, The Czar's Spy: The Mystery of Silent Love is a story of international espionage, mystery, and forbidden romance. Using his own research and experience as a journalist and adventurer, Le Queux crafts an accessible, entertaining tale for readers in search of a literary escape. Known for his works of fiction and nonfiction on the possibility of Germany invading Britain--a paranoia common in the early twentieth century--William Le Queux also wrote dozens of thrillers and adventure novels for a dedicated public audience. Although critical acclaim eluded him, popular success made him one of England's bestselling writers. In The Czar's Spy: The Mystery of Silent Love, a British aristocrat named Gordon Gregg is hired by the Czar of Russia to conduct an investigation of various European prisons. Traveling from Russia to Finland, England, and Italy, Gregg hones his skills as an international spy while indulging his taste for adventure and romance--at the risk of his life. In Italy, pursuing a lead, Gregg boards a mysterious yacht, where he discovers a photograph of a beautiful woman. Overwhelmed with attraction, Gregg swears to an oath to find her, whatever the cost. Rugged and individualistic, suave and hopelessly romantic, Gordon Gregg seems a prototype for such heroes as James Bond and George Smiley. The Czar's Spy: The Mystery of Silent Love is a throwback to the simpler days of entertainment, a bestseller that holds up over a century after it appeared in print. With a beautifully designed cover and professionally typeset manuscript, this edition of William Le Queux's The Czar's Spy: The Mystery of Silent Love is a classic work of adventure fiction reimagined for modern readers.",151320761X,9781513207612,238,Fiction,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sp6IzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=sp6IzgEACAAJ&dq=mystery&hl=&cd=299&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=sp6IzgEACAAJ&dq=mystery&hl=&source=gbs_api

Day of the Dandelion,Peter Pringle,Simon & Schuster,2010-12-01,"Seeds of a new corn plant are stolen from Oxford University's botany lab, and the professor, Alastair Scott, and his Russian assistant, Tanya Petrovskaya, are missing. Alarms ring in London and Washington, where intelligence officials know that Scott was working on a supergene that could allow control over the world's entire food supply. The British government calls in Arthur Hemmings from the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew. To his coworkers, Hemmings is just another researcher in the herbarium, but for many years he has been a secret service agent, an outwardly rumpled but dashing covert adventurer. Officials see a Moscow plot. Has Scott been kidnapped? Is he dead? Have Scott and Tanya fled to Russia? And why is Oxford's vice-chancellor withholding vital information? The intrepid Hemmings follows a series of clues into the cutthroat world of international patents, where the hunt for priceless genes is always nasty and often deadly. In Arthur Hemmings, Pringle has created an original heartbreaker of a hero, a botanist detective with a dash of James Bond. Facing murderous threats, Hemmings investigates fearlessly and with devastating precision. Handsome, witty, an ambitious cook, and a wine lover, he is irresistible to a much younger American female researcher.

But it's also got an aura-spotting centaur, a chain-smoking unicorn, and an omelet-addicted dragon. Oh, and a body in the center ring. Duncan -- aka ""Brutus Fangwrath, Deadliest Dragon in the West"" -- wakes one morning to find his best friend isn't just sleeping off a hangover. He's been murdered. Suspicion for the crime quickly turns to the circus's new hire, Cordelia Quinn. After all, she's got motive, she got means, and she's got loads of circumstantial evidence stacked against her. When it looks like no one else is going to step in to help Cordelia, it's up to Duncan to unravel the case, prove Cordelia's innocence, and uncover a troubling secret along the way.

It has been a year since Tess had to trade the hustle and bustle of London life for pulling pints and moonlighting as a Cher impersonator in a backwater country pub. The sleepy Yorkshire village of Cherrywood would always be home, but a return to rural life wasn't quite the path she'd paved for herself.

The Alpine Xanadu,Mary Daheim,Ballantine Books,2014-02-25,"An exhilarating installment in Mary Daheim’s beloved and long-running small-town murder mystery series set in Alpine, Washington, and featuring unforgettable newspaper editor Emma Lord Winter in the small mountain aerie of Alpine should be as quiet as new-fallen snow on the Cascades, but from the Grocery Basket to the Venison Inn, the town is humming. At the Alpine Advocate, editor Emma Lord and her staff are on deadline with a feature about the opening of RestHaven, a new rehab and mental health facility. Front Street is buzzing with gossip about Emma’s recent engagement to Sheriff Milo Dodge. And now that fool Wayne Eriks has climbed an electric pole in the middle of a storm and got himself electrocuted. Sheriff Dodge doesn’t buy the idea that Wayne’s death is an accident. But how—and, more important, why—he died is only one of the conundrums that keep the sheriff and Emma working overtime. Why is RestHaven giving Alpine so many restless nights? What to make of allegations that someone’s trying to kill the richest man in town . . . or whispers of a rash of indecent behavior at the local high school? After Vida Runkel, the Advocate’s stalwart House & Home editor, disappears into thin air, Milo and Emma suddenly have too many loose ends to solve before they can even think about tying the knot. The Alpine Xanadu features beloved characters from the series alongside some sinister new ones—not to mention a mystery that will shake Alpine to its core. Praise for Mary Daheim and her Emma Lord mysteries “Always entertaining.”—The Seattle Times “Mary Daheim writes with wit, wisdom, and a big heart. I love her books.”—Carolyn Hart “Daheim writes . . . with dry wit, a butter-smooth style, and obvious wicked enjoyment.”—The Oregonian “The characters are great, and the plots always attention-getting.”—King Features Syndicate “Even the most seasoned mystery fans are caught off-guard by [Daheim’s] clever plot twists.”—BookLoons Reviews “Witty one-liners and amusing characterizations.”—Publishers Weekly",0345535340,9780345535344,370,Fiction,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=m_VvDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=m_VvDwAAQBAJ&dq=mystery&hl=&cd=342&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=m_VvDwAAQBAJ&dq=mystery&hl=&source=gbs_api
