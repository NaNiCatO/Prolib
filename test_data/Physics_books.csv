The book deals with this progress but includes chapters which provide the necessary background material to modern particle physics.Particle physics forms an essential part of physics curriculum. This is a textbook but will also be useful for people working in this field and for nuclear physicists, particularly those who work on topics concerning interface between nuclear and particle physics. The book is designed for a semester course for senior undergraduates and a semester course for graduate students. Formal quantum field theory is not used; a knowledge of non-relativistic quantum mechanics is required for some parts of the book; but for the remaining parts the familiarity with the Dirac equation is essential.

Solving Physics Problems,Yipeng Gu,CRC Press,2022-08-18,"This book provides a complete, consistent, and open system for studying physics problems, which not only provides high-quality teaching materials for the field of physics education (especially for Physics Olympiad training) but also points out a new direction for physics education. In this book, a form of methodology, which can comprehensively present cogitation discipline, is built up for analyzing and solving complex physics problems. The text analyzes plenty of physics problems (classical mechanics) from both theoretical and philosophical points of view to reveal the way of exerting this form. As a set of methodology reflecting the cogitation discipline, the thinking paradigm proposed in this book (called the MLQ-(ST)C paradigm) is a theoretical tool to develop people's acquisition of this ability. The paradigm successfully deconstructs the elements and the structure in physical thinking and then eliminates the obstacles of people‚Äôs underlying thinking, so that all the thinking built on it can be clear and ordered. The physics problems included in this book are significantly more difficult than similar books within the same theoretical domains involved, leading to better teaching and learning value.",1000371697,9781000371697,807,Mathematics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zV50EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=zV50EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Physics&hl=&cd=12&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zV50EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Physics of Fluids in Microgravity,Rodolfo Monti,CRC Press,2002-01-10,"In a microgravity experiment, the conditions prevalent in fluid phases can be substantially different from those on the ground and can be exploited to improve different processes. Fluid physics research in microgravity is important for the advancement of all microgravity scients: life, material, and engineering. Space flight provides a unique laboratory that allows scientists to improve their understanding of the behaviour of fluids in low gravity, allowing the investigation of phenomena and processes normally masked by the effects of gravity and thus difficult to study on Earth. Physics of Fluids in Microgravity provides a clear view of recent research and progress in the different fields of fluid research in space. The topics presented include bubles and drops dynamics, Maragoni flows, diffustion and thermodiffusion, solidfication,a nd crystal growth. The results obtained so far are, in some cases, to be confirmed by extensive research activities on the International Space station, where basic and applied microgravity experimentation will take place in the years to come.",0415275814,9780415275811,630,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FcDY9jmD7ocC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=FcDY9jmD7ocC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Physics&hl=&cd=16&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=FcDY9jmD7ocC&dq=Physics&hl=&source=gbs_api

"Gender Differences at Critical Transitions in the Careers of Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Faculty","National Research Council, Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education, Committee on National Statistics, Policy and Global Affairs, Committee on Women in Science, Engineering, and Medicine, Committee on Gender Differences in Careers of Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Faculty",National Academies Press,2010-07-18,"Gender Differences at Critical Transitions in the Careers of Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Faculty presents new and surprising findings about career differences between female and male full-time, tenure-track, and tenured faculty in science, engineering, and mathematics at the nation's top research universities. Much of this congressionally mandated book is based on two unique surveys of faculty and departments at major U.S. research universities in six fields: biology, chemistry, civil engineering, electrical engineering, mathematics, and physics. A departmental survey collected information on departmental policies, recent tenure and promotion cases, and recent hires in almost 500 departments. A faculty survey gathered information from a stratified, random sample of about 1,800 faculty on demographic characteristics, employment experiences, the allocation of institutional resources such as laboratory space, professional activities, and scholarly productivity. This book paints a timely picture of the status of female faculty at top universities, clarifies whether male and female faculty have similar opportunities to advance and succeed in academia, challenges some commonly held views, and poses several questions still in need of answers.

How Finns Learn Mathematics and Science,N/A,BRILL,2007-01-01,"The Finnish students‚Äôsuccess in the first PISA 2000 evaluation was a surprise to most of the Finns, and even people working in teacher education and educational administration had difficulties to believe that this situation would continue. Finland‚Äôs second success in the next PISA 2003 comparison has been very pleasing for teachers and teacher educators, and for education policymakers. The good results on the second time waked us to think seriously on possible reasons for the success. Several international journalists and expert delegations from different countries have asked these reasons while visiting in Finland. Since we had no commonly acceptable explanation to students‚Äôsuccess, we decided at the University of Helsinki to put together a book ‚ÄúHow Finns Learn Mathematics and Science?‚Äù, in order to give a commonly acceptable explanation to our students‚Äôsuccess in the international PISA evaluations. The book tries to explain the Finnish teacher education and school system as well as Finnish children‚Äôs learning environment at the level of the comprehensive school, and thus give explanations for the Finnish PISA success. The book is a joint enterprise of Finnish teacher educators. The explanations for success given by altogether 40 authors can be classified into three groups: Teacher and teacher education, school and curriculum, and other factors, like the use of ICT and a developmental project LUMA. The main result is that there is not one clear explanation, although research-based teacher education seems to have some influence. But the true explanation may be a combination of several factors.",9087902441,9789087902445,289,Education,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6XkfEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=6XkfEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA60&dq=Physics&hl=&cd=23&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=6XkfEAAAQBAJ&dq=Physics&hl=&source=gbs_api

Modern Physics for Engineers,Jasprit Singh,John Wiley & Sons,2008-11-20,"Linking physics fundamentals to modern technology-a highly applied primer for students and engineers Reminding us that modern inventions-new materials, information technologies, medical technological breakthroughs-are based on well-established fundamental principles of physics, Jasprit Singh integrates important topics from quantum mechanics, statistical thermodynamics, and materials science, as well as the special theory of relativity. He then goes a step farther and applies these fundamentals to the workings of electronic devices-an essential leap for anyone interested in developing new technologies. From semiconductors to nuclear magnetic resonance to superconducting materials to global positioning systems, Professor Singh draws on wide-ranging applications to demonstrate each concept under discussion. He downplays extended mathematical derivations in favor of results and their real-world design implication, supplementing the book with nearly 100 solved examples, 120 figures, and 200 end-of-chapter problems.

Physics Education and Gender,"Allison J. Gonsalves, Anna T. Danielsson",Springer Nature,2020-04-24,"This Edited Volume engages with concepts of gender and identity as they are mobilized in research to understand the experiences of learners, teachers and practitioners of physics. The focus of this collection is on extending theoretical understandings of identity as a means to explore the construction of gender in physics education research. This collection expands an understanding of gendered participation in physics from a binary gender deficit model to a more complex understanding of gender as performative and intersectional with other social locations (e.g., race, class, LGBT status, ability, etc). This volume contributes to a growing scholarship using sociocultural frameworks to understand learning and participation in physics, and that seeks to challenge dominant understandings of who does physics and what counts as physics competence. Studying gender in physics education research from a perspective of identity and identity construction allows us to understand participation in physics cultures in new ways. We are able to see how identities shape and are shaped by inclusion and exclusion in physics practices, discourses that dominate physics cultures, and actions that maintain or challenge structures of dominance and subordination in physics education. The chapters offered in this book focus on understanding identity and its usefulness in various contexts with various learner or practitioner populations. This scholarship collectively presents us with a broad picture of the complexity inherent in doing physics and doing gender.",3030419339,9783030419332,187,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=id7eDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=id7eDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Physics&hl=&cd=38&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=id7eDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

How to Cheat at Deploying and Securing RFID,"Frank Thornton, Paul Sanghera",Syngress,2011-04-18,"RFID is a method of remotely storing and receiving data using devices called RFID tags. RFID tags can be small adhesive stickers containing antennas that receive and respond to transmissions from RFID transmitters. RFID tags are used to identify and track everything from Exxon EZ pass to dogs to beer kegs to library books. Major companies and countries around the world are adopting or considering whether to adopt RFID technologies. Visa and Wells Fargo are currently running tests with RFID, airports around the world are using RFID to track cargo and run customs departments, universities such as Slippery Rock are providing RFID-enabled cell phones for students to use for campus charges. According to the July 9 CNET article, RFID Tags: Big Brother in Small Packages?, ""You should become familiar with RFID technology because you'll be hearing much more about it soon. Retailers adore the concept, and CNET News.com's own Alorie Gilbert wrote last week about how Wal-Mart and the U.K.-based grocery chain Tesco are starting to install ""smart shelves"" with networked RFID readers.

Philosophy of Physics: A Very Short Introduction,David Wallace,Oxford University Press,2021-04-22,"Very Short Introductions: Brilliant, Sharp, Inspiring Philosophy of physics is concerned with the deepest theories of modern physics - notably quantum theory, our theories of space, time and symmetry, and thermal physics - and their strange, even bizarre conceptual implications. A deeper understanding of these theories helps both physics, through pointing the way to new theories and new applications, and philosophy, through seeing how our worldview has to change in the light of what we learn from physics. This Very Short Introduction explores the core topics in philosophy of physics through three key themes. The first - the nature of space, time, and motion - begins by considering the philosophical puzzles that led Isaac Newton to propose the existence of absolute space, and then discusses how those puzzles change - but do not disappear - in the context of the revolutions in our understanding of space and time that came first from special, and then from general, relativity. The second - the emergence of irreversible behavior in statistical mechanics - considers how the microscopic laws of physics, which know of no distinction between past and future, can be compatible with the melting of ice, the cooling of coffee, the passing of youth, and all the other ways in which the large-scale world distinguishes past from future. The last section discusses quantum theory - the foundation of most of modern physics, yet mysterious to this day. It explains just why quantum theory is so difficult to make sense of, how we might nonetheless attempt to do it, and why the question has been highly relevant to the development of physics, and continues to be so.

Introduction to High Energy Physics,Donald H. Perkins,Cambridge University Press,2000-04-13,"This highly-regarded text provides a comprehensive introduction to modern particle physics. Extensively rewritten and updated, this 4th edition includes developments in elementary particle physics, as well as its connections with cosmology and astrophysics. As in previous editions, the balance between experiment and theory is continually emphasised. The stress is on the phenomenological approach and basic theoretical concepts rather than rigorous mathematical detail. Short descriptions are given of some of the key experiments in the field, and how they have influenced our thinking. Although most of the material is presented in the context of the Standard Model of quarks and leptons, the shortcomings of this model and new physics beyond its compass (such as supersymmetry, neutrino mass and oscillations, GUTs and superstrings) are also discussed. The text includes many problems and a detailed and annotated further reading list.",1139643371,9781139643375,454,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=R3UgAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=R3UgAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Physics&hl=&cd=55&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=R3UgAwAAQBAJ&dq=Physics&hl=&source=gbs_api
Physics And Culture,Brian Cotterell,World Scientific,2017-08-29,"The role of physics in our culture is examined from the time of Newton to the present day. It has three parts: an introduction to physics and two parts covering the roles of Newtonian and Modern/Postmodern physics. It is shown how popularization enabled physics to become part of our culture, while the topics discussed include religion, philosophy, politics, literature, the visual arts, and music. An underlying theme is that physics is an intimate part of our culture which, together with the other sciences, has had a wide general influence that cannot be ignored.The book has been written for all that are genuinely interested in culture.

Introduction To Nuclear And Particle Physics (2nd Edition),"Ashok Das, Thomas Ferbel",World Scientific,2003-12-23,"The original edition of Introduction to Nuclear and Particle Physics was used with great success for single-semester courses on nuclear and particle physics offered by American and Canadian universities at the undergraduate level. It was also translated into German, and used overseas. Being less formal but well-written, this book is a good vehicle for learning the more intuitive rather than formal aspects of the subject. It is therefore of value to scientists with a minimal background in quantum mechanics, but is sufficiently substantive to have been recommended for graduate students interested in the fields covered in the text.In the second edition, the material begins with an exceptionally clear development of Rutherford scattering and, in the four following chapters, discusses sundry phenomenological issues concerning nuclear properties and structure, and general applications of radioactivity and of the nuclear force. This is followed by two chapters dealing with interactions of particles in matter, and how these characteristics are used to detect and identify such particles. A chapter on accelerators rounds out the experimental aspects of the field. The final seven chapters deal with elementary-particle phenomena, both before and after the realization of the Standard Model. This is interspersed with discussion of symmetries in classical physics and in the quantum domain, bringing into full focus the issues concerning CP violation, isotopic spin, and other symmetries. The final three chapters are devoted to the Standard Model and to possibly new physics beyond it, emphasizing unification of forces, supersymmetry, and other exciting areas of current research.The book contains several appendices on related subjects, such as special relativity, the nature of symmetry groups, etc. There are also many examples and problems in the text that are of value in gauging the reader's understanding of the material.",9814483338,9789814483339,417,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NAzJCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=NAzJCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Physics&hl=&cd=66&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NAzJCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Physics of Ionized Gases,Boris M. Smirnov,Wiley-VCH,2001-03-30,"A comprehensive textbook and reference for the study of the physics of ionized gases The intent of this book is to provide deep physical insight into the behavior of gases containing atoms and molecules from which one or more electrons have been ionized. The study of these so-called plasmas begins with an overview of plasmas as they are found in nature and created in the laboratory. This serves as a prelude to a comprehensive study of plasmas, beginning with low temperature and ""ideal"" plasmas and extending to radiation and particle transport phenomena, the response of plasmas to external fields, and an insightful treatment of plasma waves, plasma instabilities, nonlinear phenomena in plasmas, and the study of plasma interactions with surfaces. In all cases, the emphasis is on a clear and unified understanding of the basic physics that underlies all plasma phenomena. Thus, there are chapters on plasma behavior from the viewpoint of atomic and molecular physics, as well as on the macroscopic phenomena involved in physical kinetics of plasmas and the transport of radiation and of charged particles within plasmas. With this grounding in the fundamental physics of plasmas, the notoriously difficult subjects of nonlinear phenomena and of instabilities in plasmas are then treated with comprehensive clarity.",0471175943,9780471175940,0,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7J3kwAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=7J3kwAEACAAJ&dq=Physics&hl=&cd=70&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=7J3kwAEACAAJ&dq=Physics&hl=&source=gbs_api

Upgrading Physics Education to Meet the Needs of Society,Maur√≠cio Pietrocola,N/A,2019,"Nations around the globe consider physics education an important tool of economic and social development and currently advocate the use of innovative strategies to prepare students for knowledge and skills acquisition. Particularly in the last decade, a series of revisions were made to physics curricula in an attempt to cope with the changing needs and expectations of society. Educational transformation is a major challenge due to educational systems‚Äô resistance to change. Updated curriculum content, pedagogical facilities (for example, computers in a school), new teaching and learning strategies and the prejudice against girls in physics classes are all issues that have to be addressed. Educational research provides a way to build schemas and resources to promote changes in physics education. This volume presents physics teaching and learning research connected with the main educational scenarios.",3319961640,9783319961644,N/A,SCIENCE,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ctkIxQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=ctkIxQEACAAJ&dq=Physics&hl=&cd=78&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=ctkIxQEACAAJ&dq=Physics&hl=&source=gbs_api
Physics of the Human Body,Richard P. McCall,Johns Hopkins University Press,2010-05-09,"Richard P. McCall's fascinating book explains how basic concepts of physics apply to the fundamental activities and responses of the human body, a veritable physics laboratory. Blood pumping through our veins is a vital example of Poiseuille flow; the act of running requires friction to propel the runner forward; and the quality of our eyesight demonstrates how properties of light enable us to correct near- and far-sightedness. Each chapter discusses a fundamental physics concept and relates it to the anatomy and physiology of applicable parts of the body. Topics include motion, fluids and pressure, temperature and heat, speech and hearing, electrical behaviors, optics, biological effects of radiation, and drug concentrations. Clear and compelling, with a limited amount of math, McCall's descriptions allow readers of all levels to appreciate the physics of the human physique. Physics of the Human Body will help curious high school students, undergraduates with medical aspirations, and practicing medical professionals understand more about the underlying physics principles of the human body.",0801894565,9780801894565,0,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IIVLuAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=IIVLuAAACAAJ&dq=Physics&hl=&cd=79&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=IIVLuAAACAAJ&dq=Physics&hl=&source=gbs_api

Solar and Space Physics, from the National Research Council's (NRC's) Committee for a Decadal Strategy in Solar and Space Physics, is the second NRC decadal survey in heliophysics. Building on the research accomplishments realized during the past decade, the report presents a program of basic and applied research for the period 2013-2022 that will improve scientific understanding of the mechanisms that drive the Sun's activity and the fundamental physical processes underlying near-Earth plasma dynamics, determine the physical interactions of Earth's atmospheric layers in the context of the connected Sun-Earth system, and enhance greatly the capability to provide realistic and specific forecasts of Earth's space environment that will better serve the needs of society. Although the recommended program is directed primarily at NASA and the National Science Foundation for action, the report also recommends actions by other federal agencies, especially the parts of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration charged with the day-to-day (operational) forecast of space weather.

Phenomenological Approaches to Physics,"Harald A. Wiltsche, Philipp Berghofer",Springer Nature,2020-06-23,"This book offers fresh perspective on the role of phenomenology in the philosophy of physics which opens new avenues for discussion among physicists, ""standard"" philosophers of physics and philosophers with phenomenological leanings. Much has been written on the interrelations between philosophy and physics in the late 19th and early 20th century, and on the emergence of philosophy of science as an autonomous philosophical sub-discipline. This book is about the under-explored role of phenomenology in the development and the philosophical interpretation of 20th century physics. Part 1 examines questions about the origins and value of phenomenological approaches to physics. Does the work of classical phenomenologists such as Husserl, Merleau-Ponty or Heidegger contain elements of systematic value to both the practice and our philosophical understanding of physics? How did classical phenomenology influence ‚Äústandard‚Äù philosophy of science in the Anglo-American and other traditions? Part 2 probes questions on the role of phenomenology in the philosophies of physics and science: - Can phenomenology help to solve ‚ÄúWigner‚Äôs puzzle‚Äù, the problem of the ""unreasonable effectiveness"" of mathematics in describing, explaining and predicting empirical phenomena? - Does phenomenology allow better understanding of the principle of gauge invariance at the core of the standard model of contemporary particle physics? - Does the phenomenological notion of ‚ÄúLifeworld‚Äù stand in opposition to the ‚Äúscientific metaphysics‚Äù movement, or is there potential for dialogue? Part 3 examines the measurement problem. Is the solution outlined by Fritz London and Edmond Bauer merely a re-statement of von Neumann‚Äôs view, or should it be regarded as a distinctively phenomenological take on the measurement problem? Is phenomenology a serious contender in continuing discussions of foundational questions of quantum mechanics? Can other interpretational frameworks such as quantum Bayesianism benefit from implementing phenomenological notions such as constitution or horizonal intentionality?",3030469735,9783030469733,258,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=F_7sDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=F_7sDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Physics&hl=&cd=88&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=F_7sDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

The Physics of Phonons,Gyaneshwar P. Srivastava,CRC Press,2022-09-28,"This fully updated second edition of The Physics of Phonons remains the most comprehensive theoretical discussion devoted to the study of phonons, a major area of condensed matter physics. It contains exciting new sections on phonon-related properties of solid surfaces, atomically thin materials (such as graphene and monolayer transition metal chalcogenides), in addition to nano- structures and nanocomposites, thermoelectric nanomaterials, and topological nanomaterials, with an entirely new chapter dedicated to topological nanophononics and chiralphononics. Although primarily theoretical in approach, the author refers to experimental results wherever possible, ensuring an ideal book for both experimental and theoretical researchers. The author begins with an introduction to crystal symmetry and continues with a discussion of lattice dynamics in the harmonic approximation, including the traditional phenomenological approach and the more recent ab initio approach, detailed for the first time in this book. A discussion of anharmonicity is followed by the theory of lattice thermal conductivity, presented at a level far beyond that available in any other book. The chapter on phonon interactions is likewise more comprehensive than any similar discussion elsewhere. The sections on phonons in superlattices, impure and mixed crystals, quasicrystals, phonon spectroscopy, Kapitza resistance, and quantum evaporation also contain material appearing in book form for the first time. The book is complemented by numerous diagrams that aid understanding and is comprehensively referenced for further study. With its unprecedented wide coverage of the field, The Physics of Phonons is an indispensable guide for advanced undergraduates, postgraduates, and researchers working in condensed matter physics and materials science.

Deep Learning and Physics,"Akinori Tanaka, Akio Tomiya, Koji Hashimoto",Springer,2022-02-22,"What is deep learning for those who study physics? Is it completely different from physics? Or is it similar? In recent years, machine learning, including deep learning, has begun to be used in various physics studies. Why is that? Is knowing physics useful in machine learning? Conversely, is knowing machine learning useful in physics? This book is devoted to answers of these questions. Starting with basic ideas of physics, neural networks are derived naturally. And you can learn the concepts of deep learning through the words of physics. In fact, the foundation of machine learning can be attributed to physical concepts. Hamiltonians that determine physical systems characterize various machine learning structures. Statistical physics given by Hamiltonians defines machine learning by neural networks. Furthermore, solving inverse problems in physics through machine learning and generalization essentially provides progress and even revolutions in physics. For these reasons, in recent years interdisciplinary research in machine learning and physics has been expanding dramatically. This book is written for anyone who wants to learn, understand, and apply the relationship between deep learning/machine learning and physics. All that is needed to read this book are the basic concepts in physics: energy and Hamiltonians. The concepts of statistical mechanics and the bracket notation of quantum mechanics, which are explained in columns, are used to explain deep learning frameworks.

"The Beauty of Physics: Patterns, Principles, and Perspectives",A. R. P. Rau,OUP Oxford,2014-09-25,"The beauty of physics lies in its coherence in terms of a few fundamental concepts and principles. Even physicists have occasion to marvel at the overarching reach of basic principles and their ability to account for features stretching from the microscopic sub-atomic world to the cosmological expanses of the Universe. While mathematics is its natural language, physics is mostly about patterns, connections, and relations between objects and phenomena, and it is this aspect that is emphasized in this book. Since science tries to connect phenomena that at first sight appear widely different, while boiling them down to a small set of essential principles and laws, metaphor and analogy pervade our subject. Consider the pendulum, its swing from one extreme to the other often invoked in social or economic contexts. In molecular vibrations, such as in the CO2 molecule, the quantum motions of electrons and nuclei are metaphorically the pendulums. In electromagnetic radiation, including the visible light we observe, there are not even any concrete material particles, only electric and magnetic fields executing simple harmonic motion. But, to a physicist, they are all ""just a pendulum"". The selection of topics reflects the author's own four-decade career in research physics and his resultant perspective on the subject. While aimed primarily at physicists, including junior students, this book also addresses other readers who are willing to think with symbols and simple algebra in understanding the physical world around us. Each chapter, on themes such as dimensions, transformations, symmetries, or maps, begins with simple examples accessible to all while connecting them later to more sophisticated realizations in more advanced topics of physics.",0191019895,9780191019890,194,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VkWZBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=VkWZBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Physics&hl=&cd=102&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VkWZBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Mathematical Physics,"Bruce R. Kusse, Erik A. Westwig",John Wiley & Sons,2010-01-05,"What sets this volume apart from other mathematics texts is its emphasis on mathematical tools commonly used by scientists and engineers to solve real-world problems. Using a unique approach, it covers intermediate and advanced material in a manner appropriate for undergraduate students. Based on author Bruce Kusse's course at the Department of Applied and Engineering Physics at Cornell University, Mathematical Physics begins with essentials such as vector and tensor algebra, curvilinear coordinate systems, complex variables, Fourier series, Fourier and Laplace transforms, differential and integral equations, and solutions to Laplace's equations. The book moves on to explain complex topics that often fall through the cracks in undergraduate programs, including the Dirac delta-function, multivalued complex functions using branch cuts, branch points and Riemann sheets, contravariant and covariant tensors, and an introduction to group theory. This expanded second edition contains a new appendix on the calculus of variation -- a valuable addition to the already superb collection of topics on offer. This is an ideal text for upper-level undergraduates in physics, applied physics, physical chemistry, biophysics, and all areas of engineering.

The book discusses physics in a non-specialized way. Alpine Physics is mostly organized in categories relevant for non-scientists with an interest in alpine environments.Intuitive decision-making is often just grounded in plain common sense, to which mountain and nature lovers relate easily, especially when involving high-stakes decisions based on the estimation of such a treacherous environment. The book highlights how this intuitive decision-making can be complemented and augmented by basic scientific knowledge, and with better understanding it leads one to become a rational decision-maker.The book stimulates its readers to reason and discover why things are the way they are, at high altitudes, where many risk factors are aggravated, often dramatically, by steep gradients.

The Physics of Climate Change,Lawrence M. Krauss,Bloomsbury Publishing,2021-02-04,"'Brilliant and fundamental, this is the necessary book about our prime global emergency' Ian McEwan The news is full of hotly debated and divergent claims about the impacts and risks of climate change. Lawrence Krauss, one of the world's most respected physicists and science popularizers, cuts through the confusion by succinctly presenting the underlying science of climate change. The Physics of Climate Change provides a clear, accurate and accessible perspective of climate science and the risks of global inaction. Krauss's narrative explores the history of how scientists progressed to our current understanding of the Earth's climate and its future. Its generous complement of informative diagrams and illustrations allows readers to assess which climate predictions are securely based on analysis of empirical data, and which are more speculative. The Physics of Climate Change is required reading for anyone interested in understanding humanity's role in the future of our planet.",1800244797,9781800244795,184,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Uq2fEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=Uq2fEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Physics&hl=&cd=130&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Uq2fEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

In Quest of the Quark,Dr. Linda Bartrom-Olsen,Xlibris Corporation,2013-12-26,"In Quest of the Quark reinforces atomic theory for high school students, and links it with Elementary Particle Physics in a structured way that encourages literacy without heavy mathematics, by interrelating the particles which make up sub-atomic particles. At the beginning of the universe matter/energy were one, and then in the first few micro-seconds of time, they split apart or separated, a process called symmetry splitting in Particle Physics, or more commonly The Big Bang. The particles of matter, called fermions, are the bricks of the universe, and the bosons which transmit the forces of energy, the mortar which binds them together. This fundamental view of our time-continuum is quite elegant in its organization, and startling in its beauty, as the worlds within worlds of fundamental particles are explored.",1493150855,9781493150854,72,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gDS6AgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=gDS6AgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Physics&hl=&cd=146&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gDS6AgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Symmetry and the Standard Model,Matthew Robinson,Springer,2011-08-17,"While theoretical particle physics is an extraordinarily fascinating field, the incredibly fast pace at which it moves along, combined with the huge amount of background information necessary to perform cutting edge research, poses a formidable challenge for graduate students. This book represents the first in a series designed to assist students in the process of transitioning from coursework to research in particle physics. Rather than reading literally dozens of physics and mathematics texts, trying to assimilate the countless ideas, translate notations and perspectives, and see how it all fits together to get a holistic understanding, this series provides a detailed overview of the major mathematical and physical ideas in theoretical particle physics. Ultimately the ideas will be presented in a unified, consistent, holistic picture, where each topic is built firmly on what has come before, and all topics are related in a clear and intuitive way. This introductory text on quantum field theory and particle physics provides both a self-contained and complete introduction to not only the necessary physical ideas, but also a complete introduction to the necessary mathematical tools. Assuming minimal knowledge of undergraduate physics and mathematics, this book lays both the mathematical and physical groundwork with clear, intuitive explanations and plenty of examples. The book then continues with an exposition of the Standard Model of Particle Physics, the theory that currently seems to explain the universe apart from gravity. Furthermore, this book was written as a primer for the more advanced mathematical and physical ideas to come later in this series.",1441982663,9781441982667,327,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EFBlkgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=EFBlkgEACAAJ&dq=Physics&hl=&cd=148&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=EFBlkgEACAAJ&dq=Physics&hl=&source=gbs_api

Theology and Modern Physics,Peter Edward Hodgson,Ashgate Publishing,2005,"The new discoveries in physics during the 20th century have stimulated intense debate about their relevance to age-old theological questions. Views range from those holding that modern physics provides a surer road to God than traditional religions, to those who say that physics and theology are incommensurable and so do not relate. At the very least, physics has stimulated renewed theological discussions. In this critical introduction to the science-theology debate, Peter E. Hodgson draws on his experience as a physicist to present the results of modern physics and the theological implications. Written for those with little or no scientific background, Hodgson describes connections between physics, philosophy and theology and then explains Newtonian physics and Victorian physics, the theories of relativity, astronomy and quantum mechanics, and distinguishes the actual results of modern physics from speculations.",N/A,N/A,300,Religion,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=--UlAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=--UlAQAAIAAJ&q=Physics&dq=Physics&hl=&cd=176&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=--UlAQAAIAAJ&dq=Physics&hl=&source=gbs_api
Statistical Field Theory,Giuseppe Mussardo,Oxford University Press,2020-03-26,"Fundamental concepts of phase transitions, such as order parameters, spontaneous symmetry breaking, scaling transformations, conformal symmetry and anomalous dimensions, have deeply changed the modern vision of many areas of physics, leading to remarkable developments in statistical mechanics, elementary particle theory, condensed matter physics and string theory. This self-contained book provides a thorough introduction to the fascinating world of phase transitions and frontier topics of exactly solved models in statistical mechanics and quantum field theory, such as renormalization groups, conformal models, quantum integrable systems, duality, elastic S-matrices, thermodynamic Bethe ansatz and form factor theory. The clear discussion of physical principles is accompanied by a detailed analysis of several branches of mathematics distinguished for their elegance and beauty, including infinite dimensional algebras, conformal mappings, integral equations and modular functions. Besides advanced research themes, the book also covers many basic topics in statistical mechanics, quantum field theory and theoretical physics. Each argument is discussed in great detail while providing overall coherent understanding of physical phenomena. Mathematical background is made available in supplements at the end of each chapter, when appropriate. The chapters include problems of different levels of difficulty. Advanced undergraduate and graduate students will find this book a rich and challenging source for improving their skills and for attaining a comprehensive understanding of the many facets of the subject.",0191092177,9780191092176,1017,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CcjXDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=CcjXDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Physics&hl=&cd=177&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CcjXDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api
Thermal Physics,Ralph Baierlein,N/A,1999,"Clear and reader-friendly, this is an ideal textbook for students seeking an introduction to thermal physics. Written by an experienced teacher and extensively class-tested, Thermal Physics provides a comprehensive grounding in thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and kinetic theory. A key feature of this text is its readily accessible introductory chapters, which begin with a review of fundamental ideas. Entropy, conceived microscopically and statistically, and the Second Law of Thermodynamics are introduced early in the book. Throughout, topics are built on a conceptual foundation of four linked elements: entropy and the Second Law, the canonical probability distribution, the partition function, and the chemical potential. As well as providing a solid preparation in the basics of the subject, the text goes on to explain exciting recent developments such as Bose-Einstein condensation and critical phenomena. Key equations are highlighted throughout, and each chapter contains a summary of essential ideas and an extensive set of problems of varying degrees of difficulty. A free solutions manual is available for instructors (ISBN 0521 658608).

Foundations of Quantum Physics,"Charles E. Burkhardt, Jacob J. Leventhal",Springer,2010-10-29,"This book is meant to be a text for a ?rst course in quantum physics. It is assumed that the student has had courses in Modern Physics and in mathematics through differential equations. The book is otherwise self-contained and does not rely on outside resources such as the internet to supplement the material. SI units are used throughoutexcept for those topics for which atomic units are especially convenient. It is our belief that for a physics major a quantum physics textbook should be more than a one- or two-semester acquaintance. Consequently, this book contains material that, while germane to the subject, the instructor might choose to omit because of time limitations. There are topics and examples included that are not normally covered in introductory textbooks. These topics are not necessarily too advanced, they are simply not usually covered. We have not, however, presumed to tell the instructor which topics must be included and which may be omitted. It is our intention that omitted subjects are available for future reference in a book that is already familiar to its owner. In short, it is our hope that the student will use the book as a reference after having completed the course. We have included at the end of most chapters a ‚ÄúRetrospective‚Äù of the chapter.

"Einstein, Physics and Reality",Jagdish Mehra,World Scientific Publishing Company Incorporated,1999,"Albert Einstein was one of the principal founders of the quantum and relativity theories. Until 1925, when Bose-Einstein statistics was discovered, he made great contributions to the foundations of quantum theory. However, after the discovery of quantum mechanics by Heisenberg and wave mechanics by Schrodinger, with the consequent development of the principles of uncertainty and complementarity, it would seem that Einstein's views completely changed. In his theory of the Brownian motion, Einstein had invoked the theory of probability to establish the reality of atoms and molecules; but, in 1916-17, when he wished to predict the exact instant when an atom would radiate -- and developed his theory of the A and B coefficients -- ""a statistical residue remained,"" which he did not quite have the courage of his convictions to accept, as he told his friend Max Born. However, he wrote later to Born that quantum mechanics ""is certainly imposing,"" but ""an inner voice tells me that it is not the real thing ... It does not bring us closer to the secret of the 'Old One'. I, at any rate, am convinced that He is not playing at dice."" At the 1927 and 1930 Solvay Conferences on Physics in Brussels, Einstein engaged in profound discussions with Niels Bohr and others about his conviction regarding classical determinism versus the statistical causality of quantum mechanics. To the end of his life he retained his belief in a deterministic philosophy. This highly interesting book explores Einstein's views on the nature and structure of physics and reality.",9810239130,9789810239138,156,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3iAC9sfY2bQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=3iAC9sfY2bQC&dq=Physics&hl=&cd=208&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=3iAC9sfY2bQC&dq=Physics&hl=&source=gbs_api

Space Physics,May-Britt Kallenrode,Springer,2014-03-12,"Observations and physical concepts are interwoven to give basic explanations of phenomena and also show the limitations in these explanations and identify some fundamental questions. Compared to conventional plasma physics textbooks this book focuses on the concepts relevant in the large-scale space plasmas. It combines basic concepts with current research and new observations in interplanetary space and in the magnetospheres. Graduate students and young researchers starting to work in this special field of science, will find the numerous references to review articles as well as important original papers helpful to orientate themselves in the literature. Emphasis is on energetic particles and their interaction with the plasma as examples for non-thermal phenomena, shocks and their role in particle acceleration as examples for non-linear phenomena.

The notion that there are universes within particles, or that particles are conscious, is ascientific, as is the hypothesis that our universe is a computer simulation. On the other hand, the idea that the universe itself is conscious is difficult to rule out entirely. According to Sabine Hossenfelder, it is not a coincidence that quantum entanglement and vacuum energy have become the go-to explanations of alternative healers, or that people believe their deceased grandmother is still alive because of quantum mechanics. Science and religion have the same roots, and they still tackle some of the same questions: Where do we come from? Where do we go to? How much can we know? The area of science that is closest to answering these questions is physics. Over the last century, physicists have learned a lot about which spiritual ideas are still compatible with the laws of nature. Not always, though, have they stayed on the scientific side of the debate. In this lively, thought-provoking book, Hossenfelder takes on the biggest questions in physics: Does the past still exist? Do particles think? Was the universe made for us? Has physics ruled out free will? Will we ever have a theory of everything? She lays out how far physicists are on the way to answering these questions, where the current limits are, and what questions might well remain unanswerable forever.

Fundamentals of Many-body Physics,Wolfgang Nolting,Springer Science & Business Media,2009-03-02,"The goal of the present course on ‚ÄúFundamentals of Theoretical Physics‚Äù is to be a direct accompaniment to the lower-division study of physics, and it aims at providing the ph- ical tools in the most straightforward and compact form as needed by the students in order to master theoretically more complex topics and problems in advanced studies and in research. The presentation is thus intentionally designed to be suf?ciently detailed and self-contained ‚Äì sometimes, admittedly, at the cost of a certain elegance ‚Äì to permit in- vidual study without reference to the secondary literature. This volume deals with the quantum theory of many-body systems. Building upon a basic knowledge of quantum mechanics and of statistical physics, modern techniques for the description of interacting many-particle systems are developed and applied to various real problems, mainly from the area of solid-state physics. A thorough revision should guarantee that the reader can access the relevant research literature without experiencing major problems in terms of the concepts and vocabulary, techniques and deductive methods found there. The world which surrounds us consists of very many particles interacting with one another, and their description requires in principle the solution of a corresponding number ofcoupledquantum-mechanicalequationsofmotion(Schrodinger Ãà equations),which,h- ever, is possible only in exceptional cases in a mathematically strict sense.

"Brief Solutions to the Big Problems in Physics, Astrophysics and Cosmology",Balungi Francis,Blurb,2020-02-12,"People have always wanted answers to the big questions. Where did we come from? How did the universe begin? What is the meaning and design behind it all? Is there anyone out there? The creation accounts of the past now seem less relevant and credible. They have been replaced by a variety of what can only be called superstitions, ranging from New Age to Star Trek. But real science can be far stranger than science fiction, and much more satisfying. I am a scientist. And a scientist with a deep fascination with physics, cosmology, the universe and the future of humanity. I was brought up by my parents to have an unwavering curiosity and, like my father, to research and try to answer the many questions that science asks us. I have spent my life travelling across the universe, inside my mind. Through theoretical physics, I have sought to answer some of the great questions. At one point, I thought I would see the end of physics as we know it, but now I think the wonder of discovery will continue long after I am gone. We are close to some of these answers, but we are not there yet. The problem is, most people believe that real science is too difficult and complicated for them to understand. But I don't think this is the case. To do research on the fundamental laws that govern the universe would require a commitment of time that most people don't have; the world would soon grind to a halt if we all tried to do theoretical physics. But most people can understand and appreciate the basic ideas if they are presented in a clear way with equations, which I believe is possible and which is something I have enjoyed trying to do throughout my life. I want to add my voice to those who demand why we must ask the big questions immediate action on the key challenges for our global community.

Understanding Physics,"Michael Mansfield, Colm O'Sullivan",John Wiley & Sons,2012-05-18,"Understanding Physics ‚Äì Second edition is a comprehensive, yet compact, introductory physics textbook aimed at physics undergraduates and also at engineers and other scientists taking a general physics course. Written with today's students in mind, this text covers the core material required by an introductory course in a clear and refreshing way. A second colour is used throughout to enhance learning and understanding. Each topic is introduced from first principles so that the text is suitable for students without a prior background in physics. At the same time the book is designed to enable students to proceed easily to subsequent courses in physics and may be used to support such courses. Mathematical methods (in particular, calculus and vector analysis) are introduced within the text as the need arises and are presented in the context of the physical problems which they are used to analyse. Particular aims of the book are to demonstrate to students that the easiest, most concise and least ambiguous way to express and describe phenomena in physics is by using the language of mathematics and that, at this level, the total amount of mathematics required is neither large nor particularly demanding. 'Modern physics' topics (relativity and quantum mechanics) are introduced at an earlier stage than is usually found in introductory textbooks and are integrated with the more 'classical' material from which they have evolved.

Five-dimensional Physics,Paul S. Wesson,World Scientific,2006,"Extra dimensions OCo beyond space and time OCo are the best methods for unifying gravity with particle physics. The basic extension is to five dimensions (5D), as in the induced-matter and membrane theory. This descriptive text gives an up-to-date account of the classical and quantum consequences of 5D physics. It includes topics that range from Einstein''s original theory of relativity to modern views on matter. The book is mathematically precise and focuses on new ideas which appeal to readers. Examples of new ideas are: The big-bang universe, which is curved by matter in 4D, may be viewed as a smooth and empty world in 5D; the uncertainty of quantum interactions in spacetime may be regarded as the consequence of deterministic laws in higher dimensions. This book will interest people who think about the ''meaning of things''. Sample Chapter(s). Chapter 1: Higher-Dimensional Physics (252 KB).

Elasticity and Fluid Dynamics,"Kip S. Thorne, Roger D. Blandford",Princeton University Press,2021-06-15,"""Kip Thorne and Roger Blandford's monumental Modern Classical Physics is now available in five stand-alone volumes that make ideal textbooks for individual graduate or advanced undergraduate courses on statistical physics; optics; elasticity and fluid dynamics; plasma physics; and relativity and cosmology. Each volume teaches the fundamental concepts, emphasizes modern, real-world applications, and gives students a physical and intuitive understanding of the subject. Statistical Physics is an essential introduction that is different from others on the subject because of its unique approach, which is coordinate-independent and geometric; embraces and elucidates the close quantum-classical connection and the relativistic and Newtonian domains; and demonstrates the power of statistical techniques--particularly statistical mechanics--by presenting applications not only to the usual kinds of things, such as gases, liquids, solids, and magnetic materials, but also to a much wider range of phenomena, including black holes, the universe, information and communication, and signal processing amid noise.

The Energy of Physics,Christopher Fischer,Cognella Academic Publishing,2015-01-21,"The Energy of Physics, Part I: Classical Mechanics and Thermodynamics gives students the opportunity to learn physics in the way that physicists understand the discipline. In contrast to standard textbooks, which introduce forces first, The Energy of Physics begins with classical mechanics using the concept of energy conservation. By inverting the standard order of presentation, the book enables students to understand and to use calculus effectively, particularly towards applications in physics. Energy conservation is also a constant theme throughout The Energy of Physics. Newton's laws are first presented in terms of work and changes in kinetic energy, and forces are introduced as the derivative of potential energy which is necessary for defining equilibrium conditions. A generalization of forces and Newton's laws then motivates the concepts of linear and angular momentum. The mode of presentation also allows thermodynamics to be incorporated throughout the text. The Energy of Physics gives students a better understanding of classical mechanics and provides a solid foundation for more advanced physics concepts and courses. The fresh, unique approach of The Energy of Physics makes it an ideal teaching tool for calculus-based physics courses for science and engineering majors.",1626614369,9781626614369,N/A,N/A,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cdxUngEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=cdxUngEACAAJ&dq=Physics&hl=&cd=252&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=cdxUngEACAAJ&dq=Physics&hl=&source=gbs_api

Developments in Mathematical and Conceptual Physics,Harish Parthasarathy,Springer,2020-06-23,"This book presents concepts of theoretical physics with engineering applications. The topics are of an intense mathematical nature involving tools like probability and random processes, ordinary and partial differential equations, linear algebra and infinite-dimensional operator theory, perturbation theory, stochastic differential equations, and Riemannian geometry. These mathematical tools have been applied to study problems in mechanics, fluid dynamics, quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, nonlinear dynamical systems, general relativity, cosmology, and electrodynamics. A particularly interesting topic of research interest developed in this book is the design of quantum unitary gates of large size using the Feynman diagrammatic approach to quantum field theory. Through this book, the reader will be able to observe how basic physics can revolutionize technology and also how diverse branches of mathematical physics like large deviation theory, quantum field theory, general relativity, and electrodynamics have many common issues that provide the starting point for unifying the whole of physics, namely in the formulation of Grand Unified Theories (GUTS).",9811550573,9789811550577,427,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Nwp0zQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=Nwp0zQEACAAJ&dq=Physics&hl=&cd=256&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=Nwp0zQEACAAJ&dq=Physics&hl=&source=gbs_api

"Chance in Physics, Computer Science and Philosophy",Walter Hehl,Springer,2022-12-02,"Chance is uncanny to us. We thought it didn't exist, that God or a reasonable explanation was behind everything. But we know today: It exists. We know that much of what surrounds us and which we do not see through, nevertheless runs causally. Unlike what was thought in the days of the Enlightenment, chance is the rule around us rather than lawful order. The clouds are stochastic fractals, the waves on the sea are pure random machinery. The philosopher Charles Peirce recognized the fundamental importance of chance in precisely this sense, even before quantum and chaos theory, and gave the doctrine its name: Tychism. Without chance there would be nothing new, no life, no creativity, no history. This book looks at chance from the perspective of physics, computer science, and philosophy. It spans from antiquity to quantum physics and shows that chance is firmly built into the world and that it would not exist without chance. This book is a translation of the original German 1st edition Der Zufall in Physik, Informatik und Philosophie by Walter Hehl, published by Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden GmbH, part of Springer Nature in 2021. The translation was done with the help of artificial intelligence (machine translation by the service DeepL.com). A subsequent human revision was done primarily in terms of content, so that the book will read stylistically differently from a conventional translation.

The Physics of Neutrinos,"Vernon Barger, Danny Marfatia, Kerry Whisnant",Princeton University Press,2012-09-30,"The physics of neutrinos--uncharged elementary particles that are key to helping us better understand the nature of our universe--is one of the most exciting frontiers of modern science. This book provides a comprehensive overview of neutrino physics today and explores promising new avenues of inquiry that could lead to future breakthroughs. The Physics of Neutrinos begins with a concise history of the field and a tutorial on the fundamental properties of neutrinos, and goes on to discuss how the three neutrino types interchange identities as they propagate from their sources to detectors. The book shows how studies of neutrinos produced by such phenomena as cosmic rays in the atmosphere and nuclear reactions in the solar interior provide striking evidence that neutrinos have mass, and it traces our astounding progress in deciphering the baffling experimental findings involving neutrinos. The discovery of neutrino mass offers the first indication of a new kind of physics that goes beyond the Standard Model of elementary particles, and this book considers the unanticipated patterns in the masses and mixings of neutrinos in the framework of proposed new theoretical models. The Physics of Neutrinos maps out the ambitious future facilities and experiments that will advance our knowledge of neutrinos, and explains why the way forward in solving the outstanding questions in neutrino science will require the collective efforts of particle physics, nuclear physics, astrophysics, and cosmology.",0691128537,9780691128535,238,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qso8NEr3XY8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=qso8NEr3XY8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Physics&hl=&cd=268&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=qso8NEr3XY8C&dq=Physics&hl=&source=gbs_api

Physics of Relativistic Objects in Compact Binaries: from Birth to Coalescence,"Monica Colpi, Piergiorgio Casella, Vittorio Gorini, Ugo Moschella, Andrea Possenti",Springer,2014-11-06,"A very attractive feature of the theory of general relativity is that it is a perfectexampleofa‚Äúfalsi?able‚Äùtheory:notunableparameterispresentinthe theory and therefore even a single experiment incompatible with a prediction of the theory would immediately lead to its inevitable rejection, at least in the physical regime of application of the aforementioned experiment. This fact provides additional scienti?c value to one of the boldest and most fascinating achievements of the human intellect ever, and motivates a wealth of e?orts in designing and implementing tests aimed at the falsi?cation of the theory. The ?rst historical test on the theory has been the de?ection of light gr- ing the solar surface (Eddington 1919): the compatibility of the theory with this ?rst experiment together with its ability to explain the magnitude of the perihelion advance of Mercury contributed strongly to boost acceptance and worldwideknowledge.However,technologicallimitations preventedphysicists from setting up more constraining tests for several decades after the formu- tion of the theory.

Magnetospheric Physics,"C.G. F√§lthammar, B. Hultqvist",Springer,2013-03-06,"This book contains the proceedings of the 1989 Crafoord Symposium organized by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. The scientific field for the Crafoord Prize of 1989 was decided in 1988 by the Academy to be Magnetospheric Physics. On September 27,1989 the Academy awarded the 1989 Crafoord Prize to Professor J. A. Van Allen, Iowa City, USA ""for his pioneer work in space research, in particular for the discovery of the high energy charged particles that are trapped in the Earth's magnetic field and form the radiation belts -often called the Van Allen belts - around the Earth"". The subject for the Crafoord Symposium, which was held on September 28-29 at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm, was Magnetospheric Physics, Achievements and Prospects. Some seventy of the world's leading scientists in magnetospheric physics (see list of participants) were invited to the Symposium. The program contained only invited papers. After the ?resentation of the Crafoord Prize Laureate, Prof. J . A. Van Allen, and his specially invited lecture: ""Active Experiments in Magnetospheric Physics"" follows in these proceedings two papers on the achievements of magnetospheric research hitherto. The main part of the proceedings (8 papers) deal with the main theme of the Symposium: How we shall carry on magnetospheric research in the future. The Symposium was organized by five members of the Academy representing the field of space physics: Lars Block (Stockholm), Rolf Bostrom (Uppsala), Kerstin Fredga (Stockholm), Carl-Gunne Fiilthammar (Stockholm) and Bengt Hultqvist (Kiruna, Chairman).",1461573785,9781461573784,0,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YLbangEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=YLbangEACAAJ&dq=Physics&hl=&cd=276&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=YLbangEACAAJ&dq=Physics&hl=&source=gbs_api

Statistical Physics of Fluids,V.I. Kalikmanov,Springer,2001-06-20,"This book grew out of the senior level lecture course I teach at Delft Univer sity and which I have taught in recent years at Eindhoven University and the University of Utrecht. Numerous discussions with students and colleagues led me to the conclusion that in spite of the existence of excellent books on the statistical theory of fluids, there is a gap between the fundamental theory and application of its concepts and techniques to practical problems. This book is an attempt to at least partially fill it. It is not intended to be a thorough and comprehensive review of liquid state theory, which would inevitably require invoking a large number of re sults without actual derivation. Rather I prefer to focus on the main physical ideas and mathematical methods of fluid theory, starting with the basic prin ciples of statistical mechanics, and present a detailed derivation of results accompanied by an explanation of their physical meaning. The same ap proach applies to several specialized topics of the liquid state, most of which are recent developments and belong to the areas of my own activities and thus reflect my personal taste. Wherever possible, theoretical predictions are compared with available experimental and simulation data.",3540417478,9783540417477,0,Technology & Engineering,en,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=AC_40AEACAAJ&dq=Physics&hl=&cd=282&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=AC_40AEACAAJ&dq=Physics&hl=&source=gbs_api
Introduction to Solid State Physics and Crystalline Nanostructures,"Giuseppe Iadonisi, Giovanni Cantele, Maria Luisa Chiofalo",Springer,2016-10-01,"This textbook provides conceptual, procedural, and factual knowledge on solid state and nanostructure physics. It is designed to acquaint readers with key concepts and their connections, to stimulate intuition and curiosity, and to enable the acquisition of competences in general strategies and specific procedures for problem solving and their use in specific applications. To these ends, a multidisciplinary approach is adopted, integrating physics, chemistry, and engineering and reflecting how these disciplines are converging towards common tools and languages in the field. Each chapter discusses essential ideas before the introduction of formalisms and the stepwise addition of complications. Questions on everyday manifestations of the concepts are included, with reasoned linking of ideas from different chapters and sections and further detail in the appendices. The final section of each chapter describes experimental methods and strategies that can be used to probe the phenomena under discussion. Solid state and nanostructure physics is constantly growing as a field of study where the fascinating quantum world emerges and otherwise imaginary things can become real, engineered with increasing creativity and control: from tinier and faster technologies realizing quantum information concepts, to understanding of the fundamental laws of Physics.

Lectures on Selected Topics in Mathematical Physics,William A. Schwalm,Morgan & Claypool Publishers,2015-12-31,"This volume is a basic introduction to certain aspects of elliptic functions and elliptic integrals. Primarily, the elliptic functions stand out as closed solutions to a class of physical and geometrical problems giving rise to nonlinear differential equations. While these nonlinear equations may not be the types of greatest interest currently, the fact that they are solvable exactly in terms of functions about which much is known makes up for this. The elliptic functions of Jacobi, or equivalently the Weierstrass elliptic functions, inhabit the literature on current problems in condensed matter and statistical physics, on solitons and conformal representations, and all sorts of famous problems in classical mechanics. The lectures on elliptic functions have evolved as part of the first semester of a course on theoretical and mathematical methods given to first and second year graduate students in physics and chemistry at the University of North Dakota. They are for graduate students or for researchers who want an elementary introduction to the subject that nevertheless leaves them with enough of the details to address real problems. The style is supposed to be informal. The intention is to introduce the subject as a moderate extension of ordinary trigonometry in which the reference circle is replaced by an ellipse. This entre depends upon fewer tools and has seemed less intimidating that other typical introductions to the subject that depend on some knowledge of complex variables. The first three lectures assume only calculus, including the chain rule and elementary knowledge of differential equations. In the later lectures, the complex analytic properties are introduced naturally so that a more complete study becomes possible.",1681742306,9781681742304,67,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Jj9iDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=Jj9iDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Physics&hl=&cd=286&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=Jj9iDwAAQBAJ&dq=Physics&hl=&source=gbs_api

Quantum Steampunk,Nicole Yunger Halpern,JHU Press,2022-04-12,"The Industrial Revolution meets the quantum-technology revolution! A steampunk adventure guide to how mind-blowing quantum physics is transforming our understanding of information and energy. Winner of the PROSE Award for Best Book in Popular Science and Popular Mathematics by the Association of American Publishers, Shortlisted for the Phi Beta Award in Science by the Phi Beta Kappa Society Victorian era steam engines and particle physics may seem worlds (as well as centuries) apart, yet a new branch of science, quantum thermodynamics, reenvisions the scientific underpinnings of the Industrial Revolution through the lens of today's roaring quantum information revolution. Classical thermodynamics, understood as the study of engines, energy, and efficiency, needs reimagining to take advantage of quantum mechanics, the basic framework that explores the nature of reality by peering at minute matters, down to the momentum of a single particle. In her exciting new book, intrepid Harvard-trained physicist Dr. Nicole Yunger Halpern introduces these concepts to the uninitiated with what she calls ""quantum steampunk,"" after the fantastical genre that pairs futuristic technologies with Victorian sensibilities. While readers follow the adventures of a rag-tag steampunk crew on trains, dirigibles, and automobiles, they explore questions such as, ""Can quantum physics revolutionize engines?"" and ""What deeper secrets can quantum information reveal about the trajectory of time?"" Yunger Halpern also describes her own adventures in the quantum universe and provides an insider's look at the work of the scientists obsessed with its technological promise. Moving from fundamental physics to cutting-edge experimental applications, Quantum Steampunk explores the field's aesthetic, shares its whimsy, and gazes into the potential of a quantum future.

Invitation to Contemporary Physics,"Quang Ho-Kim, Narendra Kumar, Harry C. S. Lam",World Scientific Publishing Company,1991,"In recent years, the exhilarating sense of discovery in the realm of physics has almost become the exclusive right of the specialist in the field. Books on contemporary physics tend to be oversimplified or too technical for the general reader to gain a proper appreciation of the appeal that this scientific quest holds for the modern-day physicist.Invitation To Contemporary Physics, however, offers a unique opportunity for the layman or new student to share in the fascination and excitement of seven of the most enthralling areas at the research frontiers of modern day physics: lasers, superconductivity, symmetries, chaos, the evolution of stars, elementary particles and cosmology.Organized into independent chapters, the book allows the reader to delve into each topic separately. Each chapter is also designed to commence at an elementary level, thus requiring little prior background knowledge from the reader. It is then developed in stages of increasing difficulty, but in such a way that any keen and determined reader will be able to comprehend. Emphasis is placed on understanding the basic principles behind the facts and ideas.The excitement and fascination in the intellectual pursuit of present-day physics is far too compelling to be left solely to the experts. The authors in this Invitation To Contemporary Physics have therefore answered the challenge of bringing it all home to the general reader. This book serves as a captivating introduction to modern-day physics for the layman, and is also an ideal reference text for a university course aiming at a general survey of contemporary physics.",N/A,N/A,550,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hM8qhVIoO0MC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=hM8qhVIoO0MC&dq=Physics&hl=&cd=311&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=hM8qhVIoO0MC&dq=Physics&hl=&source=gbs_api

The guide to sup plementary and advanced literature given in the Appendix, however, has been brought up to date. This book is addressed primarily to students taking astronomy as a prin cipal or subsidiary subject, and to scientists of related fields, but amateur as tronomers should also be able to profit from it. For most chapters an elementary knowledge of mathematics and physics will be sufficient, however, Chaps. 5 and 6 impose somewhat greater requirements. In addition the reader should already be acquainted with the basic concepts of stellar physics as treated in introduc tory books, including the spectral types, the system of stellar magnitudes and colours, absolute magnitudes and luminosities, the Herlzsprung-Russell dia gram and its interpretation. A modem textbook should use SI units. On the other hand, the use of the cgs system is still the prevailing custom in astrophysics - together with the special units of astronomy: length is quoted in parsecs [pc], mass in solar masses [M0] and time in years [a]. We have therefore compromised and employed both cgs and SI units in this book, whichever was the appropriate choice in each instance. A table for conversion of cgs units into SI units and vice versa is given in the Appendix.",3540173145,9783540173144,492,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=76uSzQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=76uSzQEACAAJ&dq=Physics&hl=&cd=353&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=76uSzQEACAAJ&dq=Physics&hl=&source=gbs_api

Farewell to Reality,Jim Baggott,Open Road Media,2013-08-06,"From acclaimed science author Jim Baggot, a lively, provocative, and ‚Äúintellectually gratifying‚Äù critique of modern theoretical physics (The Economist). Where does one draw the line between solid science and fairy-tale physics? Jim Baggott argues that there is no observational or experimental evidence for many of the ideas of modern theoretical physics: super-symmetric particles, super strings, the multiverse, the holographic principle, or the anthropic cosmological principle. Unafraid to challenge prominent theorists, Baggott offers engaging portraits of many central figures of modern physics, including Stephen Hawking, Paul Davies, John D. Barrow, Brian Greene, and Leonard Susskind.

Physics of Magnetic Flux Tubes,Margarita Ryutova,Springer,2015-03-24,"This book is the first account of the physics of magnetic flux tubes from their fundamental properties to collective phenomena in an ensembles of flux tubes. The physics of magnetic flux tubes is absolutely vital for understanding fundamental physical processes in the solar atmosphere shaped and governed by magnetic fields. High-resolution and high cadence observations from recent space and ground-based instruments taken simultaneously at different heights and temperatures not only show the ubiquity of filamentary structure formation but also allow to study how various events are interconnected by system of magnetic flux tubes. The book covers both theory and observations. Theoretical models presented in analytical and phenomenological forms are tailored for practical applications. These are welded with state-of-the-art observations from early decisive ones to the most recent data that open a new phase-space for exploring the Sun and sun-like stars.

Physics for Animators,Michele Bousquet,CRC Press,2015-12-07,"Achieving believable motion in animation requires an understanding of physics that most of us missed out on in art school. Although animators often break the laws of physics for comedic or dramatic effect, you need to know which laws you‚Äôre breaking in order to make it work. And while large studios might be able to spend a lot of time and money testing different approaches or hiring a physics consultant, smaller studios and independent animators have no such luxury. This book takes the mystery out of physics tasks like character motion, light and shadow placement, explosions, ocean movement, and outer space scenes, making it easy to apply realistic physics to your work. Physics concepts are explained in animator‚Äôs terms, relating concepts specifically to animation movement and appearance. Complex mathematical concepts are broken down into clear steps you can follow to solve animation problems quickly and effectively. Bonus companion website at www.physicsforanimators.com offers additional resources, including examples in movies and games, links to resources, and tips on using physics in your work. Uniting theory and practice, author Michele Bousquet teaches animators how to swiftly and efficiently create scientifically accurate scenes and fix problem spots, and how and when to break the laws of physics. Ideal for everything from classical 2D animation to advanced CG special effects, this book provides animators with solutions that are simple, quick, and powerful.",1135016534,9781135016531,861,Computers,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RI00CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=RI00CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Physics&hl=&cd=365&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RI00CwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Physics of Shock Waves in Gases and Plasmas,"Mikhail Andreevich Liberman, Aleksandr Lazarevich Velikovich",N/A,1986-01,"As Emile Jouguet remarked, ""the shock wave flew off the tip of the pen of a theoretician for the first time"" about a hundred years ago. The physics of shock waves has since grown into an independent branch of science closely linked with a wide range of research areas, from astrophysics and plasma physics to solid-state physics. Since the beginning, theoretical investiga¬≠ tion has kept its leading role. The present book is devoted to actual problems of the theory of shock waves in gases and plasmas, that are of general interest to physicists. It con¬≠ tains the results of studies on shock structure, stability, evolutionarity and dynamics. Of special interest is the theory of shock phenomena in mag¬≠ netic fields, which is important for applied research on controlled nuclear fusion. A substantial contribution to this theory has been made by these authors. This monograph is the first attempt in the literature to make a systematic presentation of the shock-structure theory.The theory is consistently sub¬≠ stantiated by relevant experimental results obtained recently with the use of high-power electromagnetic shock tubes. The material contained here is applicable to the solution of a wide variety of problems arising in plasma physics, nuclear fusion and cosmic gasdynamics.

Laboratory Projects in Physics,Frederick Foreman Good,Forgotten Books,2015-06-26,"Excerpt from Laboratory Projects in Physics: A Manual of Practical Experiments for Beginners These experiments have been organized for the purpose of giving concrete expression, in the field of physics, to the recent tendencies in the teaching of science with respect to aim, subject matter, and method. The physics course in a modern high school should be organized according to the recognized function of education in a democratic society. It should include units of study which the masses of boys and girls of high school age are able to pursue with profit. It should proceed toward an organization of practical situations, activities, and phenomena, the value of which will be recognized and approved by teachers, students, parents, administrators of education, and others who are responsible for the work which boys and girls do in the high school. It is intended that these experiments should form part of a physics course which includes class discussions and demonstrations. They were devised and used for several years in a beginners' course in practical physics. They differ from the conventional physics laboratory experiments in that they deal more directly with the mechanisms and appliances of everyday experience. The materials and procedure have been worked out in detail in order to aid the busy science teacher in the laborious task of placing practical laboratory study upon a workable basis. A large list of projects and problems is offered. In a year's course of thirty-six to forty weeks perhaps not more than half of the ninety-five experiments can be performed. The complete list represents two years' work unless more time is assigned to laboratory study than is the custom.

This selection of his previously unpublished correspondence illuminates changes in theoretical physics and in academic life over the course of Coleman's illustrious career.The letters show the depth of Coleman's activities and interests, including science fiction, space travel, and the US counter culture.The volume also includes Coleman's legendary lecture 'Quantum Mechanics in Your Face.'",9811201374,9789811201370,503,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VQGVEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=VQGVEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Physics&hl=&cd=381&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VQGVEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api
"Space, Time, Matter, and Form:Essays on Aristotle's Physics",David Bostock,OUP Oxford,2006-02-16,"Space, Time, Matter, and Form collects ten of David Bostock's essays on themes from Aristotle's Physics, four of them published here for the first time. The first five papers look at issues raised in the first two books of the Physics, centred on notions of matter and form, and the idea of substance as what persists through change. They also range over other of Aristotle's scientific works, such as his biology and psychology and the account of change in his De Generatione et Corruptione. The volume's remaining essays examine themes in later books of the Physics, including infinity, place, time, and continuity. Bostock argues that Aristotle's views on these topics are of real interest in their own right, independent of his notions of substance, form, and matter; they also raise some pressing problems of interpretation, which these essays seek to resolve.",0199286868,9780199286867,204,Philosophy,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BqjoEHfCeooC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=BqjoEHfCeooC&dq=Physics&hl=&cd=382&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=BqjoEHfCeooC&dq=Physics&hl=&source=gbs_api

Basic Physics of Functionalized Graphite,Pablo D. Esquinazi,Springer,2016-07-12,"This book summarizes the basic physics of graphite and newly discovered phenomena in this material. The book contains the knowledge needed to understand novel properties of functionalized graphite demonstrating the occurrence of remarkable phenomena in disordered graphite and graphite-based heterostructures. It also discusses applications of thin graphitic samples in future electronics. Graphite consists of a stack of nearly decoupled two-dimensional graphene planes. Because of the low dimensionality and the presence of Dirac fermions, much of graphite physics resembles that of graphene. On the other hand, the multi-layered nature of the graphite structure together with structural and/or chemical disorder are responsible for phenomena that are not observed yet in graphene, such as ferromagnetic order and superconductivity. Each chapter was written by one or more experts in the field whose contributions were relevant in the (re)discovery of (un)known phenomena in graphite. The book is intended as reference for beginners and experts in the field, introducing them to many aspects of the new physics of graphite, with a fresh overview of recently found phenomena and the theoretical frames to understand them.",3319393553,9783319393551,197,Technology & Engineering,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SLOqDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=SLOqDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Physics&hl=&cd=395&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SLOqDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Physics of Nonlinear Optics,"Y. V. G. S. Murti, C. Vijayan",Springer,2022-07-22,"The book is designed to serve as a textbook for courses offered to upper-undergraduate students enrolled in physics. The first edition of this book was published in 2014. As there is a demand for the next edition, it is quite natural to take note of the several advances that have occurred in the subject over the past five years and to decide which of these are appropriate for inclusion at the textbook level, given the fundamental nature and the significance of the subject area. This is the prime motivation for bringing out a revised second edition. Among the newer mechanisms and materials, the book introduces the super-continuum generation, which arises from an excellent interplay of the various mechanisms of optical nonlinearity. The topics covered in this book are quantum mechanics of nonlinear interaction of matter and radiation, formalism and phenomenology of nonlinear wave mixing processes, optical phase conjugation and applications, self-focusing and self-phase modulation and their role in pulse modification, nonlinear absorption mechanisms, and optical limiting applications, photonic switching and bi-stability, and physical mechanisms leading to a nonlinear response in a variety of materials. This book has emerged from an attempt to address the requirement of presenting the subject at the college level. This textbook includes rigorous features such as the elucidation of relevant basic principles of physics; a clear exposition of the ideas involved at an appropriate level; coverage of the physical mechanisms of non-linearity; updates on physical mechanisms and emerging photonic materials and emphasis on the experimental study of nonlinear interactions. The detailed coverage and pedagogical tools make this an ideal textbook for students and researchers enrolled in physics and related courses.",3030739813,9783030739812,0,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Jxc6zwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=Jxc6zwEACAAJ&dq=Physics&hl=&cd=397&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=Jxc6zwEACAAJ&dq=Physics&hl=&source=gbs_api

Introduction to Glass Physics,Fiona Allen,N/A,2021-12-07,"Glass is a transparent amorphous solid which is non-crystalline. It has a wide range of uses including practical, decorative and technological applications. The field of physics which studies characteristics and properties of glass is known as glass physics. Glass transition is the reversible and gradual transition in amorphous liquids from a brittle glassy stage into viscous stage. Its transition takes place when the temperature is increased. The temperature at which it takes place is called its glass transition temperature. Glass defects are central to glass physics. It is broadly applicable to domains ranging from computer science to biophysics and soft condensed-matter physics. This book provides comprehensive insights into the field of glass physics. Also included herein is a detailed explanation of the various concepts and applications of this field.

"Quantum Physics, Mini Black Holes, and the Multiverse","Yasunori Nomura, Bill Poirier, John Terning",Springer,2018-03-08,"""Modern physics is rife with provocative and fascinating ideas, from quantum mechanics to the multiverse. But as interesting as these concepts are, they are also easy to understand. This book, written with deft hands by true experts in the field, helps to illuminate some of the most important and game-changing ideas in physics today."" Sean M. Carroll ""The Multiversal book series is equally unique, providing book-length extensions of the lectures with enough additional depth for those who truly want to explore these fields, while also providing the kind of clarity that is appropriate for interested lay people to grasp the general principles involved. "" Lawrence M. Krauss This book explores, explains and debunks some common misconceptions about quantum physics, particle physics, space-time, and Multiverse cosmology. It seeks to separate science from pseudoscience. The material is presented in layperson-friendly language, followed by additional technical sections which explain basic equations and principles. This feature is very attractive to non-expert readers who nevertheless seek a deeper understanding of the theories, and wish to explore beyond just the basic description.

"Sturge's Statistical and Thermal Physics, Second Edition",Jeffrey Olafsen,CRC Press,2019-06-30,"The original work by M.D. Sturge has been updated and expanded to include new chapters covering non-equilibrium and biological systems. This second edition re-organizes the material in a more natural manner into four parts that continues to assume no previous knowledge of thermodynamics. The four divisions of the material introduce the subject inductively and rigorously, beginning with key concepts of equilibrium thermodynamics such as heat, temperature and entropy. The second division focuses on the fundamentals of modern thermodynamics: free energy, chemical potential and the partition function. The second half of the book is then designed with the flexibility to meet the needs of both the instructor and the students, with a third section focused on the different types of gases: ideal, Fermi-Dirac, Bose-Einstein, Black Body Radiation and the Photon gases. In the fourth and final division of the book, modern thermostatistical applications are addressed: semiconductors, phase transitions, transport processes, and finally the new chapters on non-equilibrium and biological systems. Key Features: Provides the most readable, thorough introduction to statistical physics and thermodynamics, with magnetic, atomic, and electrical systems addressed alongside development of fundamental topics at a non-rigorous mathematical level Includes brand-new chapters on biological and chemical systems and non-equilibrium thermodynamics, as well as extensive new examples from soft condensed matter and correction of typos from the prior edition Incorporates new numerical and simulation exercises throughout the book Adds more worked examples, problems, and exercises",1482256037,9781482256031,369,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uZalDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=uZalDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Physics&hl=&cd=416&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=uZalDwAAQBAJ&dq=Physics&hl=&source=gbs_api

"Physics, Philosophy, and the Scientific Community","K. Gavroglu, John Stachel, Marx W. Wartofsky",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-06-29,"In three volumes, a distinguished group of scholars from a variety of disciplines in the natural and social sciences, the humanities and the arts contribute essays in honor of Robert S. Cohen, on the occasion of his 70th birthday. The range of the essays, as well as their originality, and their critical and historical depth, pay tribute to the extraordinary scope of Professor Cohen's intellectual interests, as a scientist-philosopher and a humanist, and also to his engagement in the world of social and political practice. The essays presented in Physics, Philosophy, and the Scientific Community (Volume I of Essays in Honor of Robert S. Cohen) focus on philosophical and historical issues in contemporary physics: on the origins and conceptual foundations of quantum mechanics, on the reception and understanding of Bohr's and Einstein's work, on the emergence of quantum electrodynamics, and on some of the sharp philosophical and scientific issues that arise in current scientific practice (e.g. in superconductivity research). In addition, several essays deal with critical issues within the philosophy of science, both historical and contemporary: e.g. with Cartesian notions of mechanism in the philosophy of biology; with the language and logic of science - e.g. with new insights concerning the issue of a `physicalistic' language in the arguments of Neurath, Carnap and Wittgenstein; with the notion of `elementary logic'; and with rational and non-rational elements in the history of science.

Physics at the Large Hadron Collider,"Amitava Datta, B. Mukhopadhyaya, A. Raychaudhuri",Springer,2014-11-28,"In an epoch when particle physics is awaiting a major step forward, the Large Hydron Collider (LHC) at CERN, Geneva will soon be operational. It will collide a beam of high energy protons with another similar beam circulation in the same 27 km tunnel but in the opposite direction, resulting in the production of many elementary particles some never created in the laboratory before. It is widely expected that the LHC will discover the Higgs boson, the particle which supposedly lends masses to all other fundamental particles. In addition, the question as to whether there is some new law of physics at such high energy is likely to be answered through this experiment. The present volume contains a collection of articles written by international experts, both theoreticians and experimentalists, from India and abroad, which aims to acquaint a non-specialist with some basic issues related to the LHC. At the same time, it is expected to be a useful, rudimentary companion of introductory exposition and technical expertise alike, and it is hoped to become unique in its kind. The fact that there is substantial Indian involvement in the entire LHC endeavour, at all levels including fabrication, physics analysis procedures as well as theoretical studies, is also amply brought out in the collection.",8132217284,9788132217282,0,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ywDWrQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=ywDWrQEACAAJ&dq=Physics&hl=&cd=455&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=ywDWrQEACAAJ&dq=Physics&hl=&source=gbs_api

Introduction to Game Physics with Box2D,Ian Parberry,CRC Press,2016-04-08,"Written by a pioneer of game development in academia, Introduction to Game Physics with Box2D covers the theory and practice of 2D game physics in a relaxed and entertaining yet instructional style. It offers a cohesive treatment of the topics and code involved in programming the physics for 2D video games. Focusing on writing elementary game physics code, the first half of the book helps you grasp the challenges of programming game physics from scratch, without libraries or outside help. It examines the mathematical foundation of game physics and illustrates how it is applied in practice through coding examples. The second half of the book shows you how to use Box2D, a popular open source 2D game physics engine. A companion website provides supplementary material, including source code and videos. This book helps you become a capable 2D game physics programmer through its presentation of both the theory and applications of 2D game physics. After reading the book and experimenting with the code samples, you will understand the basics of 2D game physics and know how to use Box2D to make a 2D physics-based game.",1498785808,9781498785808,277,Computers,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HPEbDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=HPEbDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Physics&hl=&cd=457&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HPEbDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

The Mindas Interaction with the Laws of Physics and Cosmology,S. Jeffrey Keen,Cambridge Scholars Publishing,2019-06,"This ground-breaking book is about the emerging academic and practical study of subtle energies, which historically, have not been easy to detect. The unique experiments, numerous measurements, and resulting data presented here, have been collected over 30 years of research. The findings have resulted from pioneering discoveries leading to equations, graphs, universal constants, formulae, and laws of nature that eventually connect to cosmology, and the structure of the universe. The book proves, with high scientific and mathematical precision, that consciousness involves more than just the brain, but actually depends on the very fabric of the universe. Some of the discoveries prove that certain information can be communicated across the solar system, not only faster than light, but instantaneously. The book deals with the entanglement of large objects, and the fact that the cosmos possesses a universal consciousness. Also shown is that the mind can detect information from the outer planets, and identifies connections to a five dimensional universe and the mysterious, recently discovered dark energy. This text will be of interest to the considerable number of people worldwide involved in similar studies. These include researchers at universities and colleges currently or wishing to teach and develop this up-and-coming subject, non-professionals, and members of relevant academic societies.",1527531554,9781527531550,444,N/A,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fD2ZwwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=fD2ZwwEACAAJ&dq=Physics&hl=&cd=490&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=fD2ZwwEACAAJ&dq=Physics&hl=&source=gbs_api

Global and Stochastic Analysis with Applications to Mathematical Physics,Yuri E. Gliklikh,Springer Science & Business Media,2010-12-07,"Methods of global analysis and stochastic analysis are most often applied in mathematical physics as separate entities, thus forming important directions in the field. However, while combination of the two subject areas is rare, it is fundamental for the consideration of a broader class of problems. This book develops methods of Global Analysis and Stochastic Analysis such that their combination allows one to have a more or less common treatment for areas of mathematical physics that traditionally are considered as divergent and requiring different methods of investigation. Global and Stochastic Analysis with Applications to Mathematical Physics covers branches of mathematics that are currently absent in monograph form. Through the demonstration of new topics of investigation and results, both in traditional and more recent problems, this book offers a fresh perspective on ordinary and stochastic differential equations and inclusions (in particular, given in terms of Nelson's mean derivatives) on linear spaces and manifolds. Topics covered include classical mechanics on non-linear configuration spaces, problems of statistical and quantum physics, and hydrodynamics. A self-contained book that provides a large amount of preliminary material and recent results which will serve to be a useful introduction to the subject and a valuable resource for further research. It will appeal to researchers, graduate and PhD students working in global analysis, stochastic analysis and mathematical physics.",0857291637,9780857291639,454,Mathematics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RLsnuGTDwM8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=RLsnuGTDwM8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Physics&hl=&cd=497&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RLsnuGTDwM8C&source=gbs_api
