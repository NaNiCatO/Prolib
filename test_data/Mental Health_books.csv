Unique features include: - a broad and inclusive view of the field, providing depth and breadth for the reader - a team of international, multi-disciplinary editors and contributors, and - discussion of the many of the unresolved debates in the field about constructs and causes. The Handbook will be an invaluable resource for postgraduate students, academics and researchers studying mental health in disciplines such as psychiatry, clinical psychology, social work, occupational therapy, nursing and sociology.",1446209687,9781446209684,570,Medical,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gSp3rXNakxMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=gSp3rXNakxMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&cd=50&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gSp3rXNakxMC&source=gbs_api
Social Work and Mental Health,"Sylvia I. Mignon, MSW, PhD",Springer Publishing Company,2019-09-09,"Clear, comprehensive, and accessible, this textbook presents an overview of the contemporary American mental health system and its impact on clients and social workers. The failure of the system to provide quality care for the mentally ill is explored, including issues and policies that social workers face in accessing mental health care for their clients, while also discussing the ways in which social workers can improve the overall functioning of the system and promote the development and expansion of policy and practice innovations. This is the first textbook to examine the lack of understanding of the roots of mental illness, the challenges in classification of mental disorders for social workers, and difficult behavioral manifestations of mental illness. By looking at the flaws and disparities in the provision of mental health services, especially in relation to the criminal justice system and homelessness and mental illness, social work students will be able to apply policy and practice to improve mental health care in their everyday work. A focus on the lived experiences of the mentally ill and their families, along with the experiences of social workers, adds a unique, real-world perspective. Key Features: Delivers a clear and accessible overview and critique of social work in the broader context of mental health care in the US Reviews historical and current mental health policies, laws, and treatments, and assesses their impact on social services for the mentally ill Investigates racial and ethnic disparities in mental health provision Incorporates the experiences of people with mental illness as well as those of social workers Offers recommendations for future social work development of mental health policies and services Includes Instructors Manual with PowerPoint slides, chapter summaries and objectives, and discussion questions Addresses CSWE core competency requirements",0826164439,9780826164438,323,Social Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5jiPDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=5jiPDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA260&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&cd=51&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5jiPDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

COVID-19 and Existential Positive Psychology (PP2.0): The New Science of Self-Transcendence,"Paul T. P. Wong, Claude-Hélène Mayer, Gökmen Arslan",Frontiers Media SA,N/A,"In the era of COVID-19, many people have suffered high levels of stress and mental health problems. To cope with the widespread of suffering (physical, psychological, social, and economical) the positive psychology of personal happiness is no longer the sole approach to examine personal wellbeing. Other approaches such as Viktor Frankl’s theory of self-transcendence provide a promising framework for research and intervention on how to achieve resilience, wellbeing, and happiness through overcoming suffering and self-transcendence. The existential positive psychology of suffering complements the positive psychology of happiness, which is championed by Martin Seligman, as two equal halves of the circle of wellbeing and optimal mental health. This Research Topic aims to examine the different approaches to Positive Psychology and their influence on individual wellbeing during the COVID-19 era. One of the exciting development in the positive psychology of wellbeing is the mounting research on the adaptive benefits of negative emotions, such as shame, guilt, and anger, as well as the dialectical process of balancing negative and positive emotions. As an example, based on all the empirical research and Frankl’s self-transcendence model, Wong has developed the existential positive psychology of suffering (PP2.0) as the foundation for flourishing. Here are a few main tenets of PP2.0: (1) Life is suffering and a constant struggle throughout every stage of development, (2) The search for self-transcendence is a primary motive guided by the meaning mindset and mindful mindset. (3) Wellbeing cannot be sustainable without overcoming and transforming suffering. In this Research Topic we welcome diverse approaches discussing the following points: • The dialectic process of overcoming the challenges of every stage of development as necessary for personal growth and self-transcendence; • The role of self-transcendence in resilience, virtue, meaning, and happiness; • The upside of negative emotions; • The new science of resilience based on cultivating the resilient mindset and character; • How to make the best use of suffering to achieve out potentials & mental health.",2832507603,9782832507605,574,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TE6-EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=TE6-EAAAQBAJ&pg=PA454&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&cd=53&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=TE6-EAAAQBAJ&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&source=gbs_api

Ladrido-Ignacio",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-03-14,"It is not easy for a layman to attract attention to a book like this. Most who open the cover will be professionals in one of the many aspects of mental health. A moment's thought tells us, however, that if there is a distinction between laymen and professionals it makes no difference to a book like this. Both laymen and professionals care about what will be. That is why this book, the Congress it reports and the World Federation for Mental Health itself can be meaningful to both laymen and professional people. A look into the 80's from the point of view of mental health, cultural values and social development is for all who care about the future. The 1981 Manila Congress of the World Federation for Mental Health was a unique and special gathering. It was the first time the Federation assembled for a Congress in a developing country. In the Philippines we enjoyed the over whelming hospitality and charm of the people and a place where past and future seem as important as the present. All who attended from outside those magic islands will always remember the occasion as a special life experience. For those of you who did attend, this book can revive the stimulation and satisfaction of the Congress.

Your A-Z on Mental Health,David Musyimi Ndetei,XinXii,2016-06-01,"According to the World Health Organization, mental disorders currently account for about 12.5% of the total burden of disease. This is expected to rise to15% by 2020. Whereas the resource-rich countries have the ability to address the problems posed by mental disorders, this is not the case with poor developing countries, most of them in Africa. For most countries South of Sahara and outside South Africa, and with the exception of Kenya, they have one psychiatrist for more than one million populations. The Kenyan situation of one psychiatrist for about half-million population is no solace at all. Most of the psychiatrists (just about 70 in May 2009) are to be found mostly in the main urban areas where many are not involved in day-to-day clinical work for the general public who cannot afford private treatment. Similarly, we have a gross deficiency of other health professionals with an interest in mental health. The long and short of it is that many people in Africa with mental illness grope in the dark. They have no access to appropriately trained mental health workers to turn to. They do not even know when they have mental disorders except when they are grossly disturbed when friends and relatives go seeking for the hardly available services. It is therefore necessary to impart some knowledge to the general public so that at least they can recognize the more subtle disorders in addition to the severe ones. Through knowledge they can have increased awareness and seek help from friends. More importantly, they will understand themselves. The book covers a wide range of topics. It includes mental health disorders and how they are generally recognized and managed, covering the whole spectrum of life. It also includes description of subjects of interest in relation to mental disorders. These include rights of people with mental disorders and the spiritual aspects of mental disorders to emphasize the fact there is nothing demonic about mental disorders any more than anything being demonic about malaria. People also find themselves in special situations, such as the prospects of death and dying, either of a relative or friend. People also have to deal with emotions as a result of the death of a relative or a friend. Of special interest is the person who is facing imminent death of self and knows about it. There are also those who actually think of taking away their lives. Besides describing those common situations, the book also addresses various approaches to the management of various mental health disorders and situations, by mental health workers but most importantly what they can do for themselves in their homes and in mitigations against the costs and stigma of mental illness. The book has given a chance to people with mental disorders to express themselves. It is hoped this book will serve to demystify mental disorders, and in the process significantly destigmatize people with mental disorders and in the process allow them together with their relatives, to come forward and demand for equal treatment, services and rights from the health professionals, policy makers, and medical insurers. This book is a must-read for everybody who cares for their mental well-being and that of others.",9966007342,9789966007346,655,Medical,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HXGhDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=HXGhDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&cd=55&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HXGhDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Taking a holistic approach to mental health, the book sets out effective strategies, from creating a supportive environment to building personal skills. Three extended case studies demonstrate how principles can be applied in practice in different situations: a specific social problem (suicide); a population group (young Black and minority ethnic groups); and a medically defined problem (people with long term conditions).

Mental Health Policy for Nurses,Ian Hulatt,SAGE,2014-04-15,"Policy determines much of what nurses actually do on a daily basis, which means it is essential for nurses to engage with policy if they are to understand their own practice.

This volume is primarily about caring for individuals and families who turn to professionals at a time when their lives are unmanageable alone, but is also concerned with the care that these professions extend to their own members. It contends that these issues are closely interrelated, with appropriate communication and support being key to both.

Diversity in Global Mental Health,"Sabine Bährer-Kohler, Blanca Bolea-Alamanac",Springer Nature,2019-10-23,"Mental illness occurs in all communities, regardless of social status, gender, race, or culture. Despite this, research in mental health historically has been biased towards Western-centric heterosexual male models of disease. Many models of service have excluded sexual and ethnic minorities and may not have been inclusive of different cultures or spiritual approaches. All of these factors may in turn isolate these communities and thus lead to an increased vulnerability to disease. This brief explores the diversity of cultural, ethnic, social, and gender perspectives on how to achieve better mental health care for societies across the globe. The authors emphasize diversity focusing on lifespan aspects, while weaving in social, racial, ethnic, cultural, and gender perspectives. They further expand their analysis by zeroing in on prominent determinants in global mental health care, including globalization, international migration, specific population idiosyncrasies, climate change, and political context. Finally, it includes novel neurobiological and biomedical approaches to treatment, and a suggestions of how those can be implemented from the perspective of diversity and gender inclusiveness. Diversity in Global Mental Health will be of great interest to experts and researchers in behavioral medicine, as well as practitioners and educators working in global mental health promotion and prevention of mental illness and related fields such as psychology, social policy, and public health.",303029112X,9783030291129,106,Medical,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wMO4DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=wMO4DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA91&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&cd=71&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wMO4DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

New Law and Ethics in Mental Health Advance Directives,Penelope Weller,Routledge,2012-12-12,"The recognition of positive rights and the growing impact of human rights principles has recently orchestrated a number of reforms in mental health law, bringing increasing entitlement to an array of health services. In this book, Penelope Weller considers the relationship between human rights and mental health law, and the changing attitudes which have led to the recognition of a right to demand treatment internationally. Weller discusses the ability of those with mental health problems to use advance directives to make a choice about what treatment they receive in the future, should they still be unable to decide for themselves. Focusing on new perspectives offered by the Conventions on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), Weller explores mental health law from a variety of international perspectives including: Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, where policies differ depending on whether you are in England and Wales, or Scotland. These case studies indicate how human rights perspectives are shifting mental health law from a constricted focus upon treatment refusal, towards a recognition of positive rights. The book covers topics including: refusing treatment new approaches in human rights international perspectives in mental health law the right to demand treatment.

Crisis is too often the first point of contact for people experiencing a mental illness, while year-over-year increases in rates of anxiety, depression, traumatic stress, and death from suicide and overdose have led many to characterize the current situation as a 'pandemic' or 'epidemic' of mental illness, constituting a 'national emergency.'

The book’s selection of successful programs from diverse countries displays a lifespan approach, emphasizing the centrality of interdisciplinary educational settings in providing primary and secondary prevention and promotion interventions, and the ongoing fight against missing financial investigations, discrimination and stigma. Together, these papers make a forceful argument for rights- based responses to worldwide mental health needs as part of the commitment toward global human rights and long-term development goals.

Thrive,"Richard Layard, David M. Clark",Princeton University Press,2015-09-15,"A compelling argument for improving society's mental health through increased services and better policy Mental illness is a leading cause of suffering in the modern world. In sheer numbers, it afflicts at least 20 percent of people in developed countries. It reduces life expectancy as much as smoking does, accounts for nearly half of all disability claims, is behind half of all worker sick days, and affects educational achievement and income. There are effective tools for alleviating mental illness, but most sufferers remain untreated or undertreated. What should be done to change this? In Thrive, Richard Layard and David Clark argue for fresh policy approaches to how we think about and deal with mental illness, and they explore effective solutions to its miseries and injustices. Layard and Clark show that modern psychological therapies are highly effective and could potentially turn around the lives of millions of people at little or no cost. This is because treating psychological problems generates huge savings on physical health care, as well as massive economic savings through more people working. So psychological therapies would effectively pay for themselves, generating potential savings for nations the world over. Layard and Clark describe how various successful psychological treatments have been developed and explain what works best for whom. They also discuss how mental illness can be prevented through better schools and a better society, and the urgency of doing so. Illustrating why we cannot afford to ignore the issue of mental illness, Thrive opens the door to new options and possibilities for one of the most serious problems facing us today.",0691169632,9780691169637,390,Psychology,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OW6YDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=OW6YDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&cd=100&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=OW6YDwAAQBAJ&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&source=gbs_api

Understanding Mental Health and Mental Illness,Paul H. Jenkins,Routledge,2021-01-26,"The question of whether someone is psychologically healthy or mentally ill, and the fundamental nature of mental health underlying that question has been debated in cultural, academic, and clinical settings for millennia. This book provides an overview of how people have conceptualized and understood mental illness through the ages. The book begins by looking at mental illness in humanity’s evolutionary past then moves through the major historical epochs: the mythological, the Classical, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, and modern, and the postmodern. At each point, it focuses on major elements that emerged regarding how people judged sanity and insanity and places major emphasis on the growing fields of psychiatry and psychology as they emerged and developed. As the book moves into the twenty-first century, Dr. Jenkins presents his integrated model of knowledge, a systemic, holistic model of the psyche that creates a conceptual foundation for understanding both psychological wellness and disorder and approaching assessment and diagnosis. This text provides a valuable exploration of mental health and illness across the ages and gives those already well versed in the subject matter a fresh perspective on the past and new model of knowledge and assessment for the future.",0429803273,9780429803277,349,Medical,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=L2kQEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=L2kQEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&cd=106&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=L2kQEAAAQBAJ&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&source=gbs_api

Living with Mental Illness in a Globalised World,Ugo Ikwuka,Routledge,2021-05-03,"Living with Mental Illness in a Globalised World systematically examines the manifold contributions to the burdens of living with mental illness in a developing and globalised world. It explores the stigma of mental illness, the burden of which compares to the symptoms of and is sometimes considered more disabling than the illness itself. The book starts by reviewing the socio-psychological and cultural processes that contribute to stigma and providing evidence-based interventions to combat it. Chapters critically investigate the ideological and instrumental barriers to mental healthcare and establish that determining the conceptualisations of mental illness helps to unravel the reasons for the underutilisation of mental health services. A compelling case is made for a complementary healthcare model and bottom-up approach that is sensitive to the spiritual and cultural needs of the people. The text’s specific examination of mental healthcare in African countries makes it a timely piece for assisting mental health professionals in understanding the inequities in care that Black Asian and Minority Ethnic groups face and how to improve mental healthcare and delivery to these groups.",1000382885,9781000382884,211,Medical,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ffwgEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=ffwgEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&cd=133&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=ffwgEAAAQBAJ&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&source=gbs_api

Community Mental Health,"Graham Thornicroft, Atalay Alem, Robert E. Drake, Hiroto Ito, Jair Mari, Peter McGeorge, R. Tara, Maya Semrau",John Wiley & Sons,2011-09-09,"There are wide inconsistencies between, and even within, countries in how community-orientated care is defined and interpreted. The analysis presented in this book take as a starting point an evidence-based balanced care model in which services are provided in community settings close to the populations served, with hospital stays being reduced as far as possible, usually located in acute wards in general hospitals. The surprising conclusion from the research is that the same problems arise in all countries, regardless of resource status, and thus the recommendations of this book apply to mental health provision everywhere. This book reviews the implementation of community-orientated care using the balanced care model. It summarizes the steps, obstacles and mistakes that have been encountered in the implementation of community mental health care worldwide and presents guidelines on how to avoid them. It proposes realistic and achievable recommendations for the development and implementation of community-orientated mental health care over the next ten years. These guidelines will be of practical use to psychiatrists and other mental health and public health practitioners at all levels worldwide, including policy makers, commissioners, funders, non-governmental organisations, service users and carers. A core message of the book is that the mental health sector will more powerfully advocate for better services in future through strong and unified alliances, especially with powerful representation from consumer/service user and carer groups. Community-orientated care draws on a wide range of practitioners, providers, care and support systems (both professional and non-professional), though particular components may play a larger or lesser role in different settings depending on the local context and the available resources, especially trained staff. Research by a WPA task force has demonstrated that most of the challenges are common and global, but with local variations. The book is therefore relevant to psychiatrists and mental health workers in developed countries who are trying to deliver better health care on reduced budgets and for those in the developing economies who are in the position to modernise their mental health care. It provides clear, concise guidance on policy and practice decisions, learning from what has and has not worked in regions in the world. The book contains many tables documenting the evidence, supported by an essential reference list, and a Key Points summary for each chapter.

The Immune System and Mental Health,"Hymie Anisman, Shawn Hayley, Alexander W. Kusnecov",Academic Press,2018-07-19,"The Immune System and Mental Health fully investigates how immune-related cellular, molecular and anatomical changes impact mental functioning. The book combines human and animal studies to reveal immunological changes related to mental-health problems. In addition, users will find comprehensive information on new research related to the microbial composition of the gut, aka, the microbiome, and how it influences brain function and mental health. Common comorbidities with mental illness and their inherent immunological or inflammatory components are also covered. Written by leaders in the field, the book synthesizes basic and clinical research to provide a thorough understanding on the role of immunity in neuropsychiatry. Sociology, psychology, psychiatry, neuroscience and genetics have provided considerable explanations and solutions to some of the most intractable mental-health problems. But researchers are increasingly relying on investigations of the immune system to identify factors that can undermine and impair mental health. This book covers devastating mental-health conditions, such as depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and autism-like spectrum disorders.

Examining Mental Health through Social Constructionism,"Michelle O'Reilly, Jessica Nina Lester",Springer,2017-09-26,"This book explores social constructionism and the language of mental distress. Mental health research has traditionally been dominated by genetic and biomedical explanations that provide only partial explanations. However, process research that utilises qualitative methods has grown in popularity. Situated within this new strand of research, the authors examine and critically assess some of the different contributions that social constructionism has made to the study of mental distress and to how those diagnosed are conceptualized and labeled. This will be an invaluable introduction and source of practical strategies for academics, researchers and students as well as clinical practitioners, mental health professionals, and others working with mental health such as educationalists and social workers.",3319600958,9783319600956,374,Psychology,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BZs3DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=BZs3DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&cd=180&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BZs3DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Mental Health Across the Lifespan,"Mary Steen, Michael Thomas",Routledge,2015-10-05,"Mental wellbeing is an integral part of being, and feeling, healthy, and it is estimated that one in four people will suffer from some form of mental illness during their lifetime. In spite of this, it is often overlooked in mainstream healthcare. The overall aim of this book is to provide knowledge and understanding of how mental health affects human beings from conception through to end-of-life, and the challenges that society as a whole has to address in the treatment of mental health. Beginning with an exploration of historical, social and cultural contexts, the book then goes on to discuss mental health care, and mental health promotion, during pregnancy and early parenthood, childhood, adolescence and young adulthood, adulthood for both men and women, and in older people. Containing reflective exercises, the chapters are designed to provide an easily-accessible and engagingly-written introduction to mental health. Containing chapters that can be read and reviewed in isolation, or used as an entire text, Mental Health Across the Lifespan: A Handbook provides a solid introduction to mental health for students. The book will also act as a useful reference for doctors, nurses, midwives, health visitors, allied health professionals, and health and social care support workers who have no specialist mental health training but often work in partnership with, and care for, people suffering from mental health issues.",1317693876,9781317693871,363,Medical,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YQWpCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=YQWpCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&cd=185&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=YQWpCgAAQBAJ&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&source=gbs_api

Routledge International Handbook of Critical Mental Health,Bruce Cohen,Routledge,2017-09-22,"The Routledge International Handbook of Critical Mental Health offers the most comprehensive collection of theoretical and applied writings to date with which students, scholars, researchers and practitioners within the social and health sciences can systematically problematise the practices, priorities and knowledge base of the Western system of mental health. With the continuing contested nature of psychiatric discourse and the work of psy-professionals, this book is a timely return to theorising the business of mental health as a social, economic, political and cultural project: one which necessarily involves the consideration of wider societal and structural dynamics including labelling and deviance, ideological and social control, professional power, consumption, capital, neoliberalism and self-governance. Featuring original essays from some of the most established international scholars in the area, the Handbook discusses and provides updates on critical theories of mental health from labelling, social constructionism, antipsychiatry, Foucauldian and Marxist approaches to critical feminist, race and queer theory, critical realism, critical cultural theory and mad studies. Over six substantive sections, the collection additionally demonstrates the application of such theoretical ideas and scholarship to key topics including medicalisation and pharmaceuticalisation, the DSM, global psychiatry, critical histories of mental health, and talk therapy. Bringing together the latest theoretical work and empirical case studies from the US, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Europe and Canada, the Routledge International Handbook of Critical Mental Health demonstrates the continuing need to think critically about mental health and illness, and will be an essential resource for all who study or work in the field.",1315399563,9781315399560,438,Social Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xOE2DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=xOE2DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&cd=195&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=xOE2DwAAQBAJ&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&source=gbs_api

Public Mental Health,William W. Eaton,Oxford University Press,2012-06-28,"Mental disorders are among the most prevalent sources of disease burden in the world. Increasing recognition of this burden has led to an explosion of scientific research as well as widespread public attention. Understanding causes and consequences of mental health and mental disorders from the perspective of public health involves unique methods and concepts from many disciplines, including population-based surveys in a life course framework. Prevention and control of mental disorders involves design and execution of intervention trials to prevent disorder in individuals who are currently healthy, and to minimize future consequences for those with current disorder or a history of disorder. Interventions of this type are important because good mental health protects against onset of a variety of mental disorders, as well as being a valued outcome in itself. The complexity of the brain and its relationship to social life requires concepts, methods, and syntheses that are new for epidemiology and public health. Public Mental Health provides a comprehensive introduction and reference for the public health approach to mental and behavioral disorders, and to promotion of mental health. The volume's chapter authors and coauthors are drawn from the internationally renowned faculty of the Department of Mental Health of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, a department uniquely positioned to create this important resource for researchers, students, and public health practitioners. The volume explicates the latest methodologies for studying the occurrence of mental disorders in populations and provides estimates of burden, cultural differences, natural history, and disparities between population subgroups. It includes reviews of genes as sources of risk for mental disorders, the occurrence of stresses and their timing over the life span, and crises and disasters as sources of risk. The book includes chapters on the structure and functioning of the mental health service system in the United States, and around the world, and a comprehensive review of population-based strategies of intervention to lower risk. A final chapter lays out a path for the evolution of public mental health in the future.",0199938407,9780199938407,572,Medical,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NPRQEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=NPRQEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&cd=209&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NPRQEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Normality Does Not Equal Mental Health,Steven James Bartlett,Bloomsbury Publishing USA,2011-09-12,"How do you define good mental health? This controversial, counterintuitive, and altogether fascinating book argues that ""psychological normality"" is neither a desirable nor an acceptable standard. Normality Does Not Equal Mental Health: The Need to Look Elsewhere for Standards of Good Psychological Health is a groundbreaking work, the first book-length study to question the equation of psychological normality and mental health. Its author, Dr. Steven James Bartlett, musters compelling evidence and careful analysis to challenge the paradigm accepted by mental health theorists and practitioners, a paradigm that is not only wrong, but can be damaging to those to whom it is applied—and to society as a whole. In this bold, multidisciplinary work, Bartlett critiques the presumed standard of normality that permeates contemporary consciousness. Showing that the current concept of mental illness is fundamentally unacceptable because it is scientifically unfounded and the result of flawed thinking, he argues that adherence to the gold standard of psychological normality leads to nothing less than cultural impoverishment.",0313399328,9780313399329,332,Psychology,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6ojDEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=6ojDEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&cd=273&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6ojDEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

These stresses include inside and outside pressures by the world to succeed, financial worries, concerns about uncertain futures, social problems and opportunities since college is often the meeting place for future mates, and homework and tests in multiple and complex subjects requiring preparation and focus with often conflicting priorities. Unsuccessful coping often results in anxiety, heavy drinking, depression and a host of other mental health problems.

What Mental Illness Really Is... (and what it isn’t),Lucy Foulkes,Random House,2022-04-21,"'A must-read... Fascinating' Jo Brand We need to rethink the conversation around mental health - psychologist Lucy Foulkes explores how and why. How do mental health problems arise? How do we distinguish between the 'normal' challenges of modern life and actual illness? Is society really experiencing a new mental health crisis? In this urgently needed book, psychologist Lucy Foulkes investigates what we know about mental illness - and shines a light on what we don't. It offers a profound new approach to how we think, talk and help when it comes to mental health. (Previously published in 2021 in hardback under the title Losing Our Minds.)

Mental Health,P.-A. Tengland,Springer Science & Business Media,2001-11-30,"The author's aim here is to philosophically analyze the notion of positive mental health. Defining characteristics of positive mental health are described, drawing on modern psychiatric, psychoanalytical, psychological, and philosophical literature. The author finds that it is impossible to draw decisive conclusions about what characteristics constitute positive mental health, and suggests a general theory of health. Lennart Nordenfelt's holistic theory of general health is chosen to guide the rest of the discussion. The author is affiliated with Malmo University, Sweden. This book is based on his PhD thesis in the Department of Health and Society at Linkoping University.

Innovations in Global Mental Health,Samuel O. Okpaku,Springer Nature,2021-11-02,"Over the course of the last decade, political and mental entities at large have embraced global mental health: the idea that psychiatric health is vital to improved quality of life. Physicians globally have implemented guidelines recommended by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in 2007, thereby breaking down barriers to care and improving quality of life in areas where these practices have been implemented. Programs for training and education have expanded as a result. Clinicians benefit more from both local resources in some regions as well as in international collaboration and technological advancements. Even amidst all of these positive outcomes, clinicians still face some stumbling blocks. With worldwide statistics estimating that 450 million people struggle with mental, neuropsychiatric, and neurological disorders—25 percent of the world’s non-communicable disease burden—rising to these challenges prove to be no small feat, even in wealthy Western nations. Various articles and books have been published on global mental health, but few of them thoroughly cover the clinical, research, innovative, and social implications as they pertain to psychiatry; often, only one of these aspects is covered. A comprehensive text that can keep pace with the rapidly evolving literature grows more and more valuable each day as clinicians struggle to piece together the changes around the world that leave open the possibility for improved outcomes in care. This book seeks to boldly rectify this situation by identifying innovative models of service delivery, training, education, research funding, and payment systems that have proven to be exemplary in implementation and scalability or have potential for scalability. Chapters describe specific barriers and challenges, illuminating effective strategies for improved outcomes. This text is the first peer-reviewed resource to gather prestigious physicians in global mental health from around the world and disseminate their expertise in the medical community at large in a format that is updateable, making it a truly cutting-edge resource in a world constantly changed by medical, scientific, and technological advances. Innovations in Global Mental Health is the ultimate resource for psychiatrists, psychologists, primary care physicians, hospitalists, policy makers, and all medical professionals at the forefront of global mental health and its implications for the future.",303057296X,9783030572969,2272,Medical,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Pu7aEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=Pu7aEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&cd=321&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Pu7aEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

International Perspectives on Mental Health,"Barbara Fawcett, Zita Weber, Sheila Wilson",Bloomsbury Publishing,2011-11-22,"Mental distress is not exclusive to any particular group but touches the lives of people in all societies and walks of life; one in four of us will be affected by it in our lifetime. Yet the field of mental health is complex – fraught with differences in understanding and experience, variations in service provision, political agendas and professional discourses. This wide-ranging book explores a range of themes in the development of mental health policy and practice, in order to promote critical reflection and enhance understanding. Drawing on an international evidence base, it explores the historical, legal and socio-cultural dimensions of mental health, including: - Anti-discriminatory practice and the ethical tensions posed by legislation, particularly in relation to safeguarding and human rights - Trends and concerns in the field of child and adolescent mental health - The gender, ethnicity and age-related dimensions of mental ill-health - The challenges posed by dual diagnosis and faced by families and carers International Perspectives on Mental Health offers a multi-dimensional view of mental health and wellbeing, with the aim of opening up debate and inviting a more holistic conception of the field. It is required reading for students of mental health on professional and academic courses, as well as for practitioners in the health and social care field.",1350313106,9781350313101,160,Psychology,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=H_xGEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=H_xGEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&cd=323&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=H_xGEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Mental Health Uncertainty and Inevitability,"Hugh Middleton, Melanie Jordan",Palgrave Macmillan,2018-07-15,"This book offers original knowledge, debate, and understanding from frontline fieldwork data and the relations between mental health difficulties, mental healthcare provision, and social theory. Dominant discourse of the last half century has followed a medical perspective. This has marginalised contributions from social science. Furthermore purely medical approaches to mental healthcare have profound shortcomings. Thus, this book draws upon innovative research findings to rejuvenate the relationship between psychiatry and social science. It frames this by reference to certain inevitable and uncertain elements of mental health which characterise this field. Over nine chapters the volume is a unique contribution to several intersecting areas of intellectual enterprise, research, and learning — as well as a source of insight into how mental health practice and policy might be modified and improved. As a result, it appeals to a wide range of audiences including social scientists, mental health practitioners, mental health researchers, social theorists, mental health service users, and policy-makers.",3319829513,9783319829517,242,Psychology,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=I_XRugEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=I_XRugEACAAJ&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&cd=329&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=I_XRugEACAAJ&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&source=gbs_api

Modern Mental Health,Steven Walker,Critical Publishing,2013-04-23,"The World Health Organisation recently confirmed that mental Illness was set to become the biggest threat to human well-being in the twenty first century. Mental illness accounts for more disability adjusted life years lost per year than any other health condition in the UK. No other health condition matches mental ill health in the combined extent of prevalence, persistence and breadth of impact. Modern Mental Health offers an alternative and thought-provoking perspective to the conventional and orthodox understanding of mental health and how to help those suffering with mental illness. The individual contributors to this book share a passion for needs-informed person-centred care for those people affected by mental ill- health and a deep scepticism about the way help and support is organised and provided to the 1 in 4 people in the population who at some time will suffer mental health problems. The chapters include a diverse and rich mixture of stark personal testimony, reflective narrative, case studies in user-informed care, alternative models of intervention and support, rigorous empirical research and a forensic analysis of mental health law-making. Although the overarching philosophy of this book is critical of contemporary psychiatric care, each chapter offers an individual perspective on an aspect of provision. This book will appeal to social workers in mental health contexts as well as students on post qualifying courses and the Masters Degree in Social Work.

Encyclopedia of Mental Health,"Howard S. Friedman, Charlotte H. Markey",N/A,2023-06-21,"""This new, 3rd edition continues the groundbreaking emphases on a broad, multifaceted understanding of mental health, recognizing the significant variations across ages, contexts, families, cultures, and social structures. Conceptions of mental health and mental dysfunction have continually broadened, to take into account new knowledge about the genetic, biological, developmental, social, and cultural nature of human beings. This third edition of the Encyclopedia brings together these emerging trends and discoveries, to paint a comprehensive picture of mental health, in the context of overall well-being. This Encyclopedia thus includes multiple levels of analysis. First, our understanding of mental health has moved well beyond the artificial nature-nurture dichotomy; we better understand how biological tendencies unfold in a social and cultural environment. Second, to a greater extent than previously imagined, there is a strong reciprocal relation between our general health and our cognitions, moods, and mental well-being. Third, we increasingly recognize the complementary nature of prevention and treatment. A simple model of treating mental ' disease' is often ultimately futile without associated prevention efforts, but prevention cannot sensibly ignore the need for efficacious treatments."" -- page xv, Preface.",0323914977,9780323914970,0,Mental health,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=l_pw0AEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=l_pw0AEACAAJ&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&cd=351&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=l_pw0AEACAAJ&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&source=gbs_api

Social Inclusion and Mental Health,"Jed Boardman, Helen Killaspy, Gillian Mezey",RCPsych Publications,2022-12-08,"People with mental health conditions are among the most socially excluded groups in society. Mental health conditions are influenced by the social environment, which in turn shapes our social and cultural responses to the people who experience them. Much of what mental health practitioners do is 'essentially social' and the effects of their interventions are hampered by the marginalised status of many of the people that they see. This book documents the ways in which people with mental health conditions are excluded from participating in society and offers some pointers as to how this may be reversed. It highlights the need to reduce mental health inequalities and to consider the importance of material inequalities and social injustices faced by people experiencing mental ill-health. Whilst the challenges are considerable and the solutions wide-ranging, mental health practitioners can play a significant role in facilitating the social inclusion of those with mental health conditions.",100930223X,9781009302234,411,Psychology,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2kKdEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=2kKdEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&cd=396&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=2kKdEAAAQBAJ&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&source=gbs_api

Citizenship and Mental Health,Michael Rowe,N/A,2015,"More than 50 years ago, President Kennedy gave an address to Congress that launched the community mental health movement in the U.S. This movement involved a vast and complex effort to replace the wholesale institutionalization of people with serious mental illnesses with community mental health centers, public education on mental illness, and prevention efforts. The mission and main thrust of this new movement, however, were quite simple: we would provide effective mental health treatment to people in their home communities and provide the conditions for them to have 'a life in the community.' Starting in the 1990s with Jim, a person who was homeless and initially refused help from outreach workers, Citizenship & Mental Health tells a 20-year story of practice, theory, and research to support the full participation of persons with mental illnesses who, in many cases, have also been homeless, have criminal charges in their past, and are poor. As the first of its kind, this book addresses the concept of citizenship as an applied theory for fulfilling the promise of the community mental health center movement. Citizenship is defined as a strong connection to the 5 R's of rights, responsibilities, roles, resources, and relationships that society offers to its members, and a sense of belonging that comes from others' recognition of one's valued membership in society. The citizenship model supports the strengths, hopes, and aspirations of people with mental illnesses to become neighbors, community members, and citizens.",019935538X,9780199355389,273,Medical,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_vCRBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=_vCRBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&cd=398&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=_vCRBQAAQBAJ&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&source=gbs_api

Personal Recovery and Mental Illness,Mike Slade,Cambridge University Press,2009-05-28,"Recovery is a concept which has emerged from the experiences of people with mental illness. It involves a shift away from traditional clinical preoccupations such as managing risk and avoiding relapse, towards new priorities of supporting the person in working towards their own goals and taking responsibility for their own life. This book sets an agenda for mental health services internationally, by converting these ideas of recovery into an action plan for professionals. The underlying principles are explored, and five reasons identified for why supporting recovery should be the primary goal. A new conceptual basis for mental health services is described - the Personal Recovery Framework - which gives primacy to the person over the illness, and identifies the contribution of personal and social identity to recovery. These are brought to life through twenty-six case studies from around the world.",1139480073,9781139480079,289,Medical,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Qgve-eD110oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=Qgve-eD110oC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&cd=409&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=Qgve-eD110oC&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&source=gbs_api
Mental Health in Asia and the Pacific,"Harry Minas, Milton Lewis",Springer,2017-02-23,"This far-reaching volume analyzes the social, cultural, political, and economic factors contributing to mental health issues and shaping treatment options in the Asian and Pacific world. Multiple lenses examine complex experiences and needs in this vast region, identifying not only cultural issues at the individual and collective levels, but also the impacts of colonial history, effects of war and disasters, and the current climate of globalization on mental illness and its care. These concerns are located in the larger context of physical health and its determinants, worldwide goals such as reducing global poverty, and the evolving mental health response to meet rising challenges affecting the diverse populations of the region. Chapters focus on countries in East, Southeast, and South Asia plus Oceania and Australia, describing: · National history of psychiatry and its acceptance. · Present-day mental health practice and services. · Mental/physical health impact of recent social change. · Disparities in accessibility, service delivery, and quality of care. · Collaborations with indigenous and community approaches to healing. · Current mental health resources, the state of policy, and areas for intervention.

It paints a picture of how mental health providers can improve their practices to better serve individuals in distress and outlines necessary steps for a mental health revolution. Eric Maisel's goal is to inject more human interaction into the therapeutic process.Maisel powerfully deconstructs the ""mental disorder"" paradigm that is the foundation of current mental health practices. The author presents a revolutionary alternative, a ""human experience"" paradigm. He sheds a bright light on the differences between so-called ""psychiatric medication"" and mere chemicals with powerful effects, explains why the DSM-5 is silent on causes, silent on treatment, and wedded to illegitimate ""symptom pictures."" Maisel describes powerful helping alternatives like communities of care, and explains why one day ""human experience specialists"" may replace current mental health professionals.An important book for both service providers and service users, The Future of Mental Health brilliantly unmasks current mental health practices and goes an important step further: it describes what we are obliged to do in order to secure better mental health services?and better mental health?for everyone.",1351482432,9781351482431,350,Medical,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uB8xDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=uB8xDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&cd=411&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=uB8xDwAAQBAJ&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&source=gbs_api

A core issue that runs throughout the text concerns the differential distribution of mental illness across various social strata, defined by status characteristics such as gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and age. The contributions to this volume shed light on the social, cultural, and economic factors that explain why some social groups have an elevated risk of disorder. They also address the social repercussions of mental disorder for individuals, including stigmatization within the larger society, and for their families and social networks.

How to Rethink Mental Illness,Bernard Guerin,Routledge,2017-03-16,"The world of mental illness is typically framed around symptoms and cures, where every client is given a label. In this challenging new book, Professor Bernard Guerin provides a fresh alternative to considering these issues, based in interdisciplinary social sciences and discourse analysis rather than medical studies or cognitive metaphors. A timely and articulate challenge to mainstream approaches, Guerin asks the reader to observe the ecological contexts for behavior rather than diagnose symptoms, to find new ways to understand and help those experiencing mental distress. This book shows the reader: how we attribute ‘mental illness’ to someone’s behavior why we call some forms of suffering ‘mental’ but not others what Western diagnoses look like when you strip away the theory and categories why psychiatry and psychology appeared for the first time at the start of modernity the relationship between capitalism and modern ideas of ‘mental illness’ why it seems that women, the poor and people of Indigenous and non-Western backgrounds have worse ‘mental health’ how we can rethink the ‘hearing of voices’ more ecologically how self-identity has evolved historically how thinking arises from our social contexts rather than from inside our heads. Offering solutions rather than theory to develop a new ‘post-internal’ psychology, How to Rethink Mental Illness will be essential reading for every mental health professional, as well as anyone who has either experienced a mental illness themselves, or helped a friend or family member who has.",1315462591,9781315462592,362,Psychology,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-wJdDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=-wJdDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&cd=420&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=-wJdDgAAQBAJ&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&source=gbs_api

Handbook of the Sociology of Mental Health,"Carol S. Aneshensel, Jo C. Phelan, Alex Bierman",Springer,2012-07-17,"This second edition of the Handbook of the Sociology of Mental Health features theory-driven reviews of recent research with a comprehensive approach to the investigation of the ways in which society shapes the mental health of its members and the lives of those who have been diagnosed as having a mental illness The award-winning Handbook is distinctive in its focus on how the organization and functioning of society influences the occurrence of mental disorder and its consequences. A core issue that runs throughout the text concerns the differential distribution of mental illness across various social strata, defined by status characteristics such as gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and age. The contributions to this volume shed light on the social, cultural, and economic factors that explain why some social groups have an elevated risk of disorder. They also address the social repercussions of mental disorder for individuals, including stigmatization within the larger society, and for their families and social networks. The second edition of this seminal volume includes substantial updates to previous chapters, as well as seven new chapters on: -The Individual’s Experience of Mental Illness.--The Medicalization of Mental Illness.---Age, Aging, and Mental Health.- -Religion and Mental Health.- -Neighborhoods and Mental Health.- -Mental Health and the Law—and Public Beliefs about Mental Illness.",9400742754,9789400742758,636,Social Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BZC9SgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=BZC9SgAACAAJ&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&cd=423&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=BZC9SgAACAAJ&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&source=gbs_api
Let's Talk Mental Health,Emmanuel Owusu,N/A,2017-08-18,"Let's Talk Mental health is a book full of stories, remarkably inspiring stories from people from all walks of life and professions who speak candidly about mental health issues. Amongst many, a comedian, teacher, doctor, and footballer reveals their stories of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, severe stress, bipolar disorder, and psychosis. In an age where there is still much stigma associated with mental illness, this is a deeply powerful book; it is written in the hope that it raises awareness of mental health issues that affects so many in society. Importantly, it encourages us to talk about mental health, which can help eradicate the stigma. ""It's ok not to be ok."" ""You need a strong support system.""

The Age of Insanity,John F. Schumaker,Bloomsbury Publishing USA,2001-08-30,"The often misunderstood modern person syndrome is a disorder linked to the conditions of living in our contemporary society. The author argues that the conditions of modernity have introduced new processes, forces, and cultural motivations that have major implications for all aspects of mental health and social well being. While modernity offers unprecedented opportunities for personal enhancement and creative expression, there is mounting evidence of a mental health crisis that demands the immediate attention of mental health professionals. In order to address the new challenges that have arisen under conditions of modernity, mental health professionals must rethink fundamental assumptions about the relationship between society and mental health, as well as the impact of modern social concerns upon individual behavior and psychological well being. This innovative approach to mental health seeks to explain a variety of psychological trends, including the steep rise in depression, the sharp increase in the prevalence of existential disorders, and the emergence of consumption disorders. By shedding light on the interaction between modernity and mental health, Schumaker illuminates the emerging patterns of mental disturbance while also offering new and more effective intervention and prevention strategies.",0313075697,9780313075698,238,Psychology,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=j7bOEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=j7bOEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&cd=425&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=j7bOEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

In the field of mental health, the use of these two approaches is growing, with emergent implications for adults with mental health conditions, their practitioners, and/or their families.

As awareness of mental health increases, so does its predominance in popular culture, which makes for a particularly interesting investigation into the representation of these concerns on our most ubiquitous streaming service: Netflix. These eight essays explore how the service's original content jumps into those conversations, creating helpful--or harmful--messaging about the inner workings of our minds. From toxic masculinity to PTSD, adolescence to motherhood, mental health touches our lives in myriad ways.

Public Health Perspectives on Depressive Disorders,Neal L. Cohen,JHU Press,2017-08-29,"How does mental health impact public health? In 2001, the WHO recognized depressive disorders as the leading cause of disability worldwide. But most Americans who meet diagnostic criteria for major depression are untreated or undertreated. Luckily, recent advances have finally made it possible for the field of public health to address mental health in the population. Public Health Perspectives on Depressive Disorders fills a gap by identifying the tools and strategies of public health practice and by exploring their application to twenty-first-century public mental health policy and practice. By looking at depressive disorders through a public health lens, this book highlights the centrality of mental health to public health. Linking the available research on depressive illness at the population level with public mental health policy and practice, expert contributors set a research agenda that will help make mental health a central part of public health science and practice. This book is an invaluable resource for researchers and practitioners to develop, facilitate, and conduct pilot and feasibility studies of promising preventive and treatment interventions that might mitigate the progression toward major depression and other mental disorders among populations at risk. The first part of the book underscores the public health significance of depressive illness by focusing on the evidence provided by recent approaches to nosology, epidemiology, illness burden, and impact on overall health. The second part looks at the social and environmental influences on depressive disorders that are critical to future efforts to prevent illness and to promote mentally healthy communities. The third and longest part addresses the vulnerability of diverse groups to depressive illness and underscore best practices to mitigate risk while improving both the preventive and therapeutic armamentaria.",1421422816,9781421422817,457,Medical,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MOEsDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=MOEsDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&cd=438&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MOEsDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Physical Activity and Mental Health,"Angela Clow, Sarah Edmunds",Human Kinetics,2013-11-08,"With contributions from internationally renowned experts, Physical Activity and Mental Health presents research illustrating how the use of physical activity can enhance well-being and reduce the impact of potentially debilitating mental health conditions. Written for students, researchers, and professionals in exercise science, fitness, and health care fields, Physical Activity and Mental Health details the factors that influence the relationship between mental health and physical activity as well as the benefits of physical activity in dealing with mental illnesses such as Alzheimer’s disease, depression, schizophrenia, and addictive behaviors. Readers will learn how promotion of physical activity can lead to a greater sense of well-being or act as a medical intervention. Exercise readiness checklists, mental health checklists, and population-specific sample activity plans assist in creating and implementing exercise programs to meet the needs of patients or clients. Physical Activity and Mental Health begins with an exploration of the brain systems that are affected by physical activity and how these affect mental well-being. The text continues with discussion of the following topics: • An overview of physical activity guidelines and the challenges in measuring physical activity in a mental health context • How physical activity promotes well-being across the life span and among socioeconomic statuses • How physical activity and exercise can improve quality of life and recovery in people with a range of mental and physical health conditions • An examination of exercise dependence, including its relationship with eating disorders and body dysmorphia and the negative impacts of excessive exercise on mental health Learning features in each chapter assist both the student and practitioner in learning and referencing the information. A chapter outline and an editors’ introduction provide an overview of the structure and content. Key concepts cover important ideas and definitions. Evidence to Practice boxes review current knowledge and theory from a perspective of practical application. Each chapter concludes with a summary and list of references, and additional highlight boxes throughout the text accent important topics. Physical Activity and Mental Health integrates theoretical and applied approaches with practical tips on exercise programs, measurement strategies, and methodological considerations. Balancing theory and practice, this resource assists students, researchers, and practitioners in understanding the links between physical activity, well-being, and mental health and how to apply this information for the benefit of patients and clients across a range of populations and conditions.",1492583022,9781492583028,314,Medical,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yu96DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=yu96DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&cd=443&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yu96DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Mental Health and Well-being Interventions in Sport,"Gavin Breslin, Gerard Leavey",Routledge,2019-01-14,"Mental health within elite sport has traditionally been ignored, but recent research has shown that competitive sport can at times seriously undermine mental health and that athletes are exposed to specific stressors that hinder their mental health optimisation. Mental Health and Well-being Interventions in Sport provides an indispensable guide for researchers and practitioners wanting to understand and implement sport-based intervention processes. This important book adopts an evidenced based approach, discussing the context of the intervention, its design and implementation, and its evaluation and legacy. With cases on depression, eating disorders, and athletic burnout, the book is designed to provide practitioners, policy makers and researchers with a cutting-edge overview of the key issues involved in this burgeoning area, while also including cases on how sport itself has been used as a method to improve mental health. Written for newcomers and established practitioners alike, the text is an essential read for researchers and practitioners in better understanding the sport setting-based intervention processes through presenting current research, theory and practice, applicable in a variety of sports settings and contexts.",1351375709,9781351375702,165,Psychology,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aRaGDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=aRaGDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&cd=446&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=aRaGDwAAQBAJ&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&source=gbs_api

Promoting Men's Mental Health,"David Conrad, Alan White",CRC Press,2016-07-06,"A welcome and important contribution to a thankfully growing debate. Mental illness remains in some ways the last great taboo in our society, a taboo which leads directly to stigma and discrimination which for some can be even worse than the symptoms of their illness. This book in part is about encouraging men who have reached crisis point to seek help. Equally it's about prevention, and sets out some of the excellent work being done on that. I hope it can inspire practitioners and policy makers to initiate similar interventions, develop new ones and lift the promotion of men's mental health much higher up the agenda, both in the UK and abroad.A"" - From the Foreword by Alastair Campbell Men - in all their diverse groups, settings, lifestyles and stages of life - can face considerable challenges to their mental wellbeing from specific cultural and societal factors, causing difficulties for themselves and those who live and work with them. In addition, these men may respond better to certain approaches and treatment. Promoting Men's Mental Health outlines the breadth of the challenges and provides guidance for those working in primary care on targeting and helping men who need support. Good mental health is more than the absence of mental illness, and this book therefore highlights methods to promote positive mental health by increasing psychological wellbeing, competency and coping skills, and by creating supportive living and working environments The book highlights examples of best practice throughout the UK, Europe and America, and will be essential reading for primary care and mental health professionals, and all those with an interest in men's mental health. 'We need to be more innovative in the way we try to reach men. This book will help stimulate further discussion and hopefully encourage men to seek help or support.'

Mental Health Ontologies,Janna Hastings,University of Exeter Press,2020-07-01,"Mental health presents one of the defining public health challenges of our time. Proponents of different conceptions of what mental illness is wage war for the hearts and minds of patients, practitioners, policy-makers, and the public. Debate and fragmentation around the nature of the entities that feature in the mental health domain divide resources and reduce progress. The way mental health is publicly discussed in the media has tangible effects, in terms of stigma, access to healthcare and resources, and private expectations of recovery. This book explores in detail the sorts of statements that are made about mental health in the media and public reporting of scientific research, grounding them in the wider context of the theoretical frameworks, assumptions and metaphors that they draw from. The author shows how a holistic understanding of the way that different aspects of mental illness are interrelated can be developed from evidence-based interpretation of the latest research findings. She offers some ideas about corrective, integrative approaches to discussing mental health-related matters publicly that may reduce the opposition between conceptualisations while still aiming to reduce stigma, shame and blame. In particular, she emphasises that discourse in the media needs to be anchored to an overview of all the research results across the field and argues that this could be achieved using new technological infrastructures. The author provides an integrative account of what mental health is, together with an improved understanding of the factors driving the persistence of oppositional accounts in the public discourse. The book will be of benefit to researchers, practitioners and students in the domain of mental health.",1905816529,9781905816521,190,Language Arts & Disciplines,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oPbvDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=oPbvDwAAQBAJ&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&cd=451&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=oPbvDwAAQBAJ&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&source=gbs_api

Nine Dimensions of Madness,Robert L. Gallon,North Atlantic Books,2015-11-17,"In a book that reframes the mental health debate, Robert L. Gallon challenges the widely-held notion that mental disorders are medical diseases. Drawing on his extensive experience as a psychologist who has worked with thousands of patients, he argues that there are no objective indicators of mental disorders and therefore no way of drawing a distinct line between people who have them and people who don't. He outlines an alternative to the disease model defined by nine dimensions of dysfunction that encompass the range of human dysfunctions typically classified as mental disorders. He explains the origin of these problems, not as chemical imbalances and genetic abnormalities, but as the complex interaction of biological, psychological and social factors, called the Biopsychosocial model. Gallon explains the history of psychiatry and how it came to develop a medical model that codifies mental disorders in the psychiatric bible, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), now in its fifth edition. He demonstrates how, in 1950s and 1960s when the miracle psychiatric drugs came on the market, it was to the great economic advantage of both pharmaceutical companies and psychiatrists to describe people's problems in the language of medicine. His alternative to this disease model suggests descriptive types--Reality Misperception, Mood Dysfunction, Anxiety, Cognitive Competence, Social Competence, Somatoform Dysfunction, Substance Dependence, Motivation and Impulse Control, and Socialization Dysfunction--that we can construct to discuss the kinds and severities of problems people experience. These are not discrete abnormalities, but are sorts of dysfunction that can be placed on dimensions of dysfunction. Table of Contents Part I History of Madness 1. Introduction and Some Definitions 2.

A Balanced Life,Tom Smith,Hazelden Publishing,2008-08-04,"A practical, compassionate guide to building a supportive relationship with someone with a mental illness--while taking care of yourself. The ultimate goal of those with a mental disorder and the people who love them is balance: emotional, mental, spiritual, and behavioral. Yet, living with and responding to a mentally ill person often leads to the chaos of a relationship where the rules change, the dynamics are volatile, and the expectations are unanchored. In readable, down-to-earth prose, A Balance Life teaches family and friends what they can expect from those they love who have mental health problems. It offers nine clear-cut strategies for implementing a plan to support them, including how to:assist a loved one in developing healthy self-esteemaccept mental illness as a fact of lifeidentify early warning signs that precede a more difficult phase of the illnesscreate a supportive network of family and friendsEach strategy is illustrated by inspiring stories of real people who have put the principles into practice, and is followed by key questions that ask to ponder their own situations. This is the to bringing order to chaos, providing a framework for reactions to the person who has a mental illness. It clarifies expectations and offers advice and encouragement.Tom Smith is the cofounder of the Karla Smith Foundation, which supports parents and loved ones of mentally ill people. He is author of several articles and books, including God on the Job and Alive in the Spirit.""A unique blend of inspiration, compassion, and practical advice, every person coming to grips with the mental health problems of a loved one deserves to hear the message of hope, love, and faith infused within this book.""

"Mental Health, Cultural Values, and Social Development","R.C. Nann, D.S. Butt, L. Ladrido-Ignacio",Springer,2010-12-30,"It is not easy for a layman to attract attention to a book like this. Most who open the cover will be professionals in one of the many aspects of mental health. A moment's thought tells us, however, that if there is a distinction between laymen and professionals it makes no difference to a book like this. Both laymen and professionals care about what will be. That is why this book, the Congress it reports and the World Federation for Mental Health itself can be meaningful to both laymen and professional people. A look into the 80's from the point of view of mental health, cultural values and social development is for all who care about the future. The 1981 Manila Congress of the World Federation for Mental Health was a unique and special gathering. It was the first time the Federation assembled for a Congress in a developing country. In the Philippines we enjoyed the over whelming hospitality and charm of the people and a place where past and future seem as important as the present. All who attended from outside those magic islands will always remember the occasion as a special life experience. For those of you who did attend, this book can revive the stimulation and satisfaction of the Congress.

Topics include the practitioner's role in mental health care of children and youth; Indigenous' perspectives on mental wellness; epidemiology of mental disorders; stigma; interventions such as evidence-based treatments and complimentary approaches; theories of resilience, attachment, and trauma; and suicide, which is a leading cause of death for young people worldwide and closely linked to mental disorders.

Overall, studies show an existence of important sex-specific differences in several aspects of psychiatric disorders such as etiology, epidemiology, clinical presentation and therapeutics. In this book, recognized experts present the current state of knowledge on this topic, providing a reliable, accurate and comprehensive clinical guide to women's mental health. The book will steer clear of an in-depth discussion of genetics and sex-based differences to focus quickly and narrowly on how best to diagnose and treat psychiatric disorders in women, thereby offering a targeted and practical guide for clinicians. It is intended to serve a broad audience -- including psychiatrists, psychologists, family physicians, obstetricians, gynecologists, nurses, social workers and other medical and mental health providers with an interest in women's mental health. Women's Mental Health: A Clinical and Evidence-Based Guide will be fully evidence-based and will present chapters authored by distinguished leaders with extensive experience and clinical wisdom in this area.

Ethical Issues in Mental Health,"Steve Baldwin, Philip J. Barker",Springer,2013-11-11,"Why write another book on ethics? As practitioners we are involved both in the design and delivery of services to people with mental health problems. In common with all other professionals, our work has led to the experience of ethical dilemmas: typically, these have involved major confrontations, either with our col leagues or our consciences. This book, however, is not limited to a discussion of such major themes. Rather, we have tried to use a broader canvas: ethics, in our view, is really about the judgement of right and wrong in ordinary, everyday life. Ethics are highly personal: we fashion our own personal code from our experi ence of others, and from the 'tests' which bring meaning to our lives. Such experiences shape our individual values. We bring these codes and values to our work. We are not always aware of their influence in our dealings with people. Although we may not always be aware of it, all our actions pose an ethical question. Given that our work involves us in helping others to live ordinary, satisfying lives, this challenge heightens the intensity of our ethical dilemmas. This is most evident where our personal code conflicts with the implicit code of the health setting.",1489932704,9781489932709,217,Medical,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9yazBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=9yazBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&cd=482&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9yazBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api
Applying Person-Centred Care in Mental Health,Wendy Hawksworth,N/A,2016,"Applying Person-centred Care in Mental Health focuses on the environment of inpatient mental health units. Here, a patient's actions are often understood through reference to their illness; if they disagree with staff they lack insight or are aggressive, if they seek independence they are uncooperative and non-compliant, if they wish to be alone they are seen as withdrawn. Imagine being this patient, faced with situations where you are told your reality is not right, that you are a different person to who you think you are and that you have a mental disorder and need treatment, even though you do not think so. Imagine the impact this clash of values could have on you, where your values are routinely undermined, ignored, or subsumed within a medical paradigm. This contemporary and unique guide will be valuable for all staff working with people with a mental illness. Its focus is on inpatient units, however it also applies to staff working in the community. The guide provides a broad understanding of values-based practice and how to work with people's values from a person-centred perspective. Developed by K.W.M. Fulford, values-based practice ensures that the person, as a patient, has their perspective acknowledged and considered in any decisions or actions taken. This book utilises a 10 principle decision-making framework to guide and enable clinicians to reflect on their engagement and clinical decisions. Using exercises and practice scenarios, values used in clinical practice, how they present in different situations and how they influence decision making are examined. It will assist you to critique and monitor your practice in order to maintain best care according to the patient's perspective.",1911028081,9781911028086,0,Medical,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lGufjwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=lGufjwEACAAJ&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&cd=483&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=lGufjwEACAAJ&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&source=gbs_api

In his latest and most critical analysis, Suman Fernando reflects on the current situation in light of his own personal experience, academic research and anecdotal reports. He weaves together themes of immense importance for the future of psychiatry and mental health services in a multi-cultural setting, exploring: * the nature of racism and its permeation into mental health services * the inside story of the struggle against racism in statutory and voluntary sectors of the mental health system * the history of psychiatry and the role of spirituality, holistic thinking, psychotherapy and Asian traditions of medicine.

"Religion, Personality, and Mental Health",Laurence B. Brown,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"LAURENCE B. BROWN Nearly all the papers in this collection were prepared initially by a group of psychologists interested in the social scientific study of religion. They included some working with the mentally ill in medical, religious, or secular contexts, as well as teachers and researchers in psychology or theology. Their papers aim to test, or to reflect on, common prejudices about the links between mental health and religion, especially when they are thought to be mediated by personality characteristics. All the papers have been revised for this collection. A clear consensus emerged that religion has many positive effects, despite Wulff's (1991"" p. 307) unguarded assertion that, ""without ques tion the mentally disturbed are frequently attracted by religion."" Any assumption that religion is necessarily a ""danger"" to health, or closely related to mental illness, is not supported by the evidence from carefully controlled studies that follow a social science perspective. Malony's paper, page 16 in this collection, therefore emphasizes that we must take account of the ways in which anyone's religion is integrated into their life, the functions it serves for them and their acceptance by other members of the religious and other groups to which they belong.",1461226961,9781461226963,225,Psychology,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZEEjBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=ZEEjBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&cd=490&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZEEjBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

This edited collection brings together selected plenary and keynote papers from the conference, and represents a major contribution to an interdisciplinary dialogue in mental health through the use of new philosophical tools, emerging from neuroscience, clinical psychology, phenomenology and epistemology. The papers gathered in this volume are divided into four parts, depending on their disciplinary paradigm. The papers included in Part I are focused on advances in neuroscience and neuroimaging as theoretical underpinnings for progress in psychiatric and psychological explanations. Special attention is paid here to the critical reappraisal of current approaches to the implementation of neuroscience in mental health. Some of these papers end with suggestions for modifications to contemporary research programs. The papers belonging to Part II contribute to the psychological understanding of mental disorders, particularly personality disorders.

The book highlights common practical problems in service user involvement, suggesting ways to avoid pitfalls and common difficulties. Combines the theoretical aspects of service user involvement in research with specific examples, as well as with general practical guidelines Represents the views of service users, in a powerful combination with the views of other mental health professionals Considers the different perspectives and needs of the stakeholders concerned Includes a step by step guide on best practice in successful service user involvement. Handbook of Service User Involvement in Mental Health Research is written for psychiatrists and other medical professionals managing people with psychiatric disorders, as well as for researchers in the mental health field who want to develop projects with service user involvement.

Brain Changer,Felice Jacka,Macmillan Publishers Aus.,2019-02-26,"'This is a fascinating book, by a leading researcher, covering one of the most exciting areas of modern nutritional research - how what we eat impacts our gut and brain. The combination of personal stories and cutting edge science is a real winner.' Michael Mosley You feel how you eat. We accept that the quality of our diet affects the health of our heart and liver. So why wouldn't diet - good or bad - affect the health of our brain? This is the question that Australian scientist Felice Jacka set out to answer. Having suffered depression and anxiety as a young woman, she wanted to understand the role diet plays in our overall mental and brain health. What she found through her own research and that of other eminent scientists worldwide will revolutionise the way we think about what we eat and how we care for our brains. * Obesity and depression are two major causes of disease and disability across the globe, and each influences the other. *Food does affect mood: highly processed foods increase depression risk, while a balanced, whole-food diet can prevent depression and improve mood. *A healthy diet improves gut health, and in turn health microbiota (gut bacteria) promote brain health and keep our weight in check. *A healthy diet improves brain performance at all ages, from school-age kids to their work-stressed parents. *The Mediterranean diet is linked to lower rates of Alzheimer's disease and general cognitive decline in older people. Professor Jacka, who leads the field of Nutritional Psychiatry research globally, provides not just the most recent scientific evidence but also a range of simple, practical solutions for improving the way we eat on a daily basis, including meal plans and a range of delicious recipes. This is not a diet book. This is a guide to the good habits that will protect your most precious organ, improve your quality of life and optimise mental and brain health across your lifespan.

Rather than promote an approach based on a single theoretical model, consideration is given to ways in which different approaches can be effectively combined within a multi-disciplinary team. The book is divided into two sections. The first outlines recent government initiatives relating to personality disorder and introduces key theories underlying psychological and biological treatments. The second focuses specifically on the role of the CMHT in relation to patients with these difficulties, including: the assessment of personality functioning developing coherent plans for treatment and support optimising the therapeutic relationship managing self-harming behaviour particular challenges faced by CMHTs, and how to overcome them the views of service users involving family, friends and carers.

Mindfulness and Mental Health examines other effects it can also have and presents a significant new model of how mindful awareness may influence different forms of mental suffering. The book assesses current understandings of what mindfulness is, what it leads to, and how and when it can help. It looks at the roots and significance of mindfulness in Buddhist psychology and at the strengths and limitations of recent scientific investigations. A survey of relationships between mindfulness practice and established forms of psychotherapy introduces evaluations of recent clinical work where mindfulness has been used with a wide range of psychological disorders. As well as considering current 'mindfulness-based' therapies, future directions for the development of new techniques, their selection, how they are used and implications for professional training are discussed. Finally, mindfulness' future contribution to positive mental health is examined with reference to vulnerability to illness, adaptation and the flourishing of hidden capabilities. As a cogent summary of the field that addresses many key questions, Mindfulness and Mental Health is likely to help therapists from all professional backgrounds in getting to grips with developments that are becoming too significant to ignore.",1135448094,9781135448097,199,Psychology,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hVWPAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=hVWPAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&cd=515&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=hVWPAgAAQBAJ&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&source=gbs_api
"The Routledge International Handbook of Race, Culture and Mental Health","Roy Moodley, Eunjung Lee",Routledge,2020-10-27,"This handbook presents a thorough examination of the intricate interplay of race, ethnicity, and culture in mental health – historical origins, subsequent transformations, and the discourses generated from past and present mental health and wellness practices. The text demonstrates how socio-cultural identities including race, gender, class, sexual orientation, disability, religion, and age intersect with clinical work in a range of settings. Case vignettes and recommendations for best practice help ground each in a clinical focus, guiding practitioners and educators to actively increase their understanding of non-Western and indigenous healing techniques, as well as their awareness of contemporary mental health theories as a product of Western culture with a particular historical and cultural perspective. The international contributors also discuss ways in which global mental health practices transcend racial, cultural, ethnic, linguistic, and political boundaries. The Routledge International Handbook of Race, Culture and Mental Health is an essential resource for students, researchers, and professionals alike as it addresses the complexity of mental health issues from a critical, global perspective.",1351995545,9781351995542,593,Psychology,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZBYHEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=ZBYHEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&cd=516&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZBYHEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

The Quest for Mental Health,Ian Robert Dowbiggin,N/A,2011,"This is the story of one of the most far-reaching human endeavors in history: the quest for mental well-being. From its origins in the eighteenth century to its wide scope in the early twenty-first, this search for emotional health and welfare has cost billions. In the name of mental health, millions around the world have been tranquilized, institutionalized, psycho-analyzed, sterilized, lobotomized and even euthanized. Yet at the dawn of the new millennium, reported rates of depression and anxiety are unprecedentedly high. Drawing on years of field research, Ian Dowbiggin argues that if the quest for emotional well-being has reached a crisis point in the twenty-first century, it is because mass society is enveloped by cultures of therapism and consumerism, which increasingly advocate bureaucratic and managerial approaches to health and welfare""",N/A,N/A,248,Electronic books,en,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=lZiZwwEACAAJ&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&cd=522&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=lZiZwwEACAAJ&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&source=gbs_api

It studies mental health as a social and psychological phenomenon, and it exposes the psychic crises that are characteristic of modern society. In the continuation, the book’s distinguishing features include a presentation of examples from the author’s therapeutic practice, a presentation in the form of a dialogue, the analysis of the therapeutic treatment through the therapist’s internal dialogue, and the final analysis of the present case. The cases are valuable material for the understanding of the individual, his/her distress, and the search for solutions within the frame of the psychotherapeutic and psychosocial help model.

Mental health law is an area of considerable legal and social complexity, and the authors challenge readers to question the system and the policies that have been developed.

Parenthood and Mental Health,"Sam Tyano, Miri Keren, Helen Herrman, John Cox",Wiley,2010-05-24,"Across all cultures parenting is the foundation of family life. It is the domain where adult mental health meets infant development. Beginning in pregnancy, parenting involves many conscious and unconscious processes which have recently been shown to affect a child's development significantly. This book focuses on pregnancy and the first year of life, providing a thorough account of the points of encounter between adult and infant psychiatry. In a fresh and comprehensive way, it summarises knowledge about early parenting, including a critical analysis of parenting, what it means to be a ""good enough parent"", and its relationship to infant, parent and family outcomes. In addition to the psychiatric dimension, the book emphasises the biological aspects of parenting, parental psychopathology and normal and abnormal infant development. Praise for Parenting and Mental Health: “Tyano, Keren, Herrman and Cox have edited a thoughtfully prepared guide on normal and abnormal parenting. They have, with enormous skill and wisdom, helped to unite the important aspects of pregnancy, infant and childhood development and parenting for adult and child and adolescent psychiatrists. World-class internationally recognized clinicians and researchers help make this book useful throughout the world. This is a masterful, culturally sensitive and important book which provides a long overdue and much needed guide on relationships among children, parents and families.” —Michelle Riba, M.D., M.S., Professor and Associate Chair for Integrated Medical and Psychiatric Services, Department of Psychiatry, University of Michigan, USA “During recent decades, progress in the field of infant mental health has been revolutionary; at the same time, there has been rapid development in women’s mental health. By bringing these two together, this pioneering book leads its readers to the vital new focal point around perinatal mental health. The book integrates the origins of developmental psychiatry in attachment and systemic contexts and shows concretely how relationship experiences and biology interact when new life begins. After describing the fascinating world of early parenting, the book focuses on problems, difficulties and disorders during this phase of life and above all on how to support, intervene and treat disorders in parenting. When infants, mothers and fathers are understood in a holistic way, professionals in many fields will be able to promote the transmission of meaningful life through parenthood and parenting.” —Tuula Tamminen, Professor of Child Psychiatry, University of Tampere, Finland; Past-President of World Association for Infant Mental Health, President of European Society for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Cover design by Reouth Keren",0470747226,9780470747223,486,Medical,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=J-z9twAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=J-z9twAACAAJ&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&cd=526&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=J-z9twAACAAJ&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&source=gbs_api

O'Connell Associate Research Scientist, Yale Program on Recovery and Community Health Yale University School of Medicine Martha Staeheli Lawless Project Director","Oxford University Press, USA",2008-08-27,"This book takes a lofty vision of ""recovery"" and of ""a life in the community"" for every adult with a serious mental illness promised by the U.S. President's 2003 New Freedom Commission on Mental Health and shows the reader what is entailed in making this vision a reality. Beginning with the historical context of the recovery movement and its recent emergence on the center stage of mental health policy around the world, the authors then clarify various definitions of mental health recovery and address the most common misconceptions of recovery held by skeptical practitioners and worried families. With this framework in place, the authors suggest fundamental principles for recovery-oriented care, a set of concrete practice guidelines developed in and for the field, a recovery guide model of practice as an alternative to clinical case management, and tools to self-assess the recovery orientation of practices and practitioners. In doing so, this volume represents the first book to go beyond the rhetoric of recovery to its implementation in everyday practice. Much of this work was developed with the State of Connecticut's Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, helping the state to win a #1 ranking in the recent NAMI report card on state mental health authorities. Since initial development of these principles, guidelines, and tools in Connecticut, the authors have become increasingly involved in refining and tailoring this approach for other systems of care around the globe as more and more governments, ministry leaders, system managers, practitioners, and people with serious mental illnesses and their families embrace the need to transform mental health services to promote recovery and community inclusion. If you've wondered what all of the recent to-do has been about with the notion of ""recovery"" in mental health, this book explains it. In addition, it gives you an insider's view of the challenges and strategies involved in transforming to recovery and a road map to follow on the first few steps down this exciting, promising, and perhaps long overdue path.",0199719519,9780199719518,272,Medical,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wrcGloLDwycC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=wrcGloLDwycC&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&cd=533&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=wrcGloLDwycC&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&source=gbs_api

Healing,"Thomas Insel, MD",National Geographic Books,2022-02-22,"A bold, expert, and actionable map for the re-invention of America’s broken mental health care system. “Healing is truly one of the best books ever written about mental illness, and I think I’ve read them all."" —Pete Earley, author of Crazy As director of the National Institute of Mental Health, Dr. Thomas Insel was giving a presentation when the father of a boy with schizophrenia yelled from the back of the room, “Our house is on fire and you’re telling me about the chemistry of the paint! What are you doing to put out the fire?” Dr. Insel knew in his heart that the answer was not nearly enough. The gargantuan American mental health industry was not healing millions who were desperately in need. He left his position atop the mental health research world to investigate all that was broken—and what a better path to mental health might look like. In the United States, we have treatments that work, but our system fails at every stage to deliver care well. Even before COVID, mental illness was claiming a life every eleven minutes by suicide. Quality of care varies widely, and much of the field lacks accountability. We focus on drug therapies for symptom reduction rather than on plans for long-term recovery. Care is often unaffordable and unavailable, particularly for those who need it most and are homeless or incarcerated. Where was the justice for the millions of Americans suffering from mental illness? Who was helping their families? But Dr. Insel also found that we do have approaches that work, both in the U.S. and globally. Mental illnesses are medical problems, but he discovers that the cures for the crisis are not just medical, but social. This path to healing, built upon what he calls the three Ps (people, place, and purpose), is more straightforward than we might imagine. Dr. Insel offers a comprehensive plan for our failing system and for families trying to discern the way forward. The fruit of a lifetime of expertise and a global quest for answers, Healing is a hopeful, actionable account and achievable vision for us all in this time of mental health crisis.",0593298047,9780593298046,0,Psychology,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hS6OEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=hS6OEAAAQBAJ&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&cd=537&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=hS6OEAAAQBAJ&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&source=gbs_api
Positive Balance,M. Joseph Sirgy,Springer Nature,2020-06-18,"The book provides a new theory of well-being designed to integrate many disparate concepts of well-being, such as subjective well-being, personal happiness, mental well-being, emotional well-being, psychological well-being, hedonic well-being, social well-being, life satisfaction, domain satisfaction, and eudaimonia. It lays the foundation for a new a theory of mental well-being based on a hierarchical perspective of positive mental health and guided by the concept of positive balance. Written by a well-known expert in the field, this book addresses the issue of positive balance related to physiological, emotional, cognitive, meta-cognitive, developmental and social-ecological levels of an individual and analyses the factors at each level that contribute to an individual’s positive mental health experience. It discusses in detail the effects of neurochemicals such as dopamine, serotonin, or cortisol; positive and negative affect; satisfaction in salient and multiple life domains vis-à-vis dissatisfaction in life domains; positive versus negative evaluations about one’s life using certain standards of comparison; positive psychological traits of personal growth and intrinsic motivation, etc. vis-à-vis negative traits like pessimism and impulsiveness; and perceived social resources like social contribution and social actualization vis-à-vis perceived constraints like exclusion and ostracism.

The Palgrave Handbook of Male Psychology and Mental Health,"John A. Barry, Roger Kingerlee, Martin Seager, Luke Sullivan",Palgrave Macmillan,2019-03-13,"This Handbook represents the first concerted effort to understand male mental health in a way that facilitates a positive step forward in both theory and treatment. An alarming number of men experience serious mental health issues, as demonstrated by high rates of suicide and violent offending. Despite these problems, the study of male psychology has either been overlooked, or viewed as a problem of defective masculinity. This handbook brings together experts from across the world to discuss men’s mental health, from prenatal development, through childhood, adolescence, and fatherhood. Men and masculinity are explored from multiple perspectives including evolutionary, cross-cultural, cognitive, biological, developmental, and existential viewpoints, with a focus on practical suggestions and demonstrations of successful clinical work with men. Throughout, chapters question existing models of understanding and treating men’s mental health and explore new approaches, theories and interventions. This definitive handbook encapsulates a new wave of positive theory and practice in the field of male psychology and will be of great value to professionals, academics, and those working with males through the lifespan in any sector related to male mental health and wellbeing.",3030043835,9783030043834,0,Social Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dQRIvQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=dQRIvQEACAAJ&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&cd=539&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=dQRIvQEACAAJ&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&source=gbs_api

Quelch, Carin-Isabel Knoop",Springer,2019-10-10,"This proactive guide brings the relationship between work life and mental well-being into sharp focus, surveying common challenges and outlining real-life solutions. The authors' approach posits managers as the chief mental health officers of their teams, offering both a science-based framework for taking stock of their own impact on the workplace and strategies for improvement. Areas for promoting mental wellness include reducing stress and stigma, building a safe climate for talking about mental health issues, recognizing at-risk employees, and embracing diversity and neurodiversity. Emphasizing key questions to which managers should be attuned, the book speaks to its readers--whether in corporate, nonprofit, start-up, or non-business organizations--as a friendly and trusted mentor. Featured in the coverage: - Mind the mind: how am I doing, and how can I do better? - Dare to care: how are my people doing, and how might I help? - Building blocks for mental health: how do I manage my team? - Stress about stressors: what is constantly changing in the environment? - Changing my organization and beyond: how can I have a greater impact?

Using practical examples, she explores often-encountered dilemmas, including: -- How can supervisors facilitate learning? -- What are the ethical bases of supervision? -- What helps to create a good working alliance? Supervision in the Mental Health Professions is a comprehensive, practical and indispensable text for supervisors and supervisees involved in mental healthcare, including clinical psychology, counselling, psychotherapy, counselling psychology, psychiatry, nursing and social work.",0415207142,9780415207140,308,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Mz_oc7jbk0gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=Mz_oc7jbk0gC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&cd=563&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=Mz_oc7jbk0gC&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&source=gbs_api

Part III: Trends adopts a broadly chronological lens critically to assess the past, examine persistent current dilemmas and speculate about an uncertain future. Key Features: * Provides an easy reference to seminal articles in mental health law * Brings together a cross-selection of articles on fundamental issues from around the world * Concluding section provides a critical analysis of the past and an assessment for the future; * Includes a substantial context setting introduction by the editor.

Mental Health Made Easy,"Jeanine Joy, Ph.d.",Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,2017-09-24,"Healthy habits of thought lead to the outcomes you want including great relationships, good health, and academic, career, and sporting success. You can know, in each moment, if the thoughts you are thinking are healthy. When you know you are thinking an unhealthy thought, you can use the empowering strategies in this book to change your thoughts to healthier ones. When it comes to coping skills, only Advanced and Transformational Stress Management Skills permanently reduce stress and make your life better every day. Almost all mental and physical illnesses can be traced back to chronic stress. Dr. Joy's groundbreaking work takes stress management to a new level. Moving away from defining emotions as positive and negative, Dr. Joy takes the conversation to the thoughts that cause the emotional response. Dr. Joy's work puts Advanced Stress Management Strategies in everyone's toolkit. Advanced Stress Management Strategies are quick, pro-active, healthy ways to reduce stress as it occurs. Transformational Stress Management Strategies change the way your automatic thoughts process the events in your life so that your initial thoughts are less stressful. Before this breakthrough, the most common stress management strategies didn't do anything more than give your mind a break. They didn't change the stress the situation created. Stress Management skills are critical because life is stressful and people who do not have good skills will use what is available, which often includes Dysfunctional strategies that quickly make things worse and Maladaptive strategies that slowly make things worse. Think of your thoughts as seeds. If you want to grow corn you don't want your thoughts to plant brussel sprouts. Everything you care about, including relationships, health, wealth, fun, and success turns out the way it does because of the thoughts you think. Good mental health no longer has to be random. Replace habits of thought that make your life more difficult than it has to be with habits of thought that make your life more fun. Dr. Joy has helped thousands of people reduce stress and improve their mental health using the same strategies you'll learn in this book. Her evidence-based, experience-informed methods integrate many scientific disciplines including emotion regulation, motivation, organizational behavior, positive psychology, organizational behavior, teams, resilience, self-determination, and self-control. She developed The Smart Way(tm) which is the name she uses to describe the combination of knowledge and skills you'll learn in this book. Dr. Joy is the founder and CEO of Happiness 1st Institute, a Thrive More Now Company. This book will make your life better every day. Why wait another day? Start enjoying life more now.",154236907X,9781542369077,300,Mental health,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HfYWtAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=HfYWtAEACAAJ&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&cd=567&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=HfYWtAEACAAJ&dq=Mental+Health&hl=&source=gbs_api
