The Romance Languages,Rebecca Posner,Cambridge University Press,1996-09-05,"What is a Romance language? How is one Romance language related to others? How did they all evolve? And what can they tell us about language in general? In this comprehensive survey Rebecca Posner, a distinguished Romance specialist, examines this group of languages from a wide variety of perspectives. Her analysis combines philological expertise with insights drawn from modern theoretical linguistics, both synchronic and diachronic. She relates linguistic features to historical and sociological factors, and teases out those elements which can be attributed to divergence from a common source and those which indicate convergence towards a common aim. Her discussion is extensively illustrated with new and original data, and an up-to-date and comprehensive bibliography is included. This volume will be an invaluable and authoritative guide for students and specialists alike.",0521281393,9780521281393,404,Foreign Language Study,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FtxywY_6g4UC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=FtxywY_6g4UC&pg=PA30&dq=romance&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=FtxywY_6g4UC&dq=romance&hl=&source=gbs_api

Romance Writing,Lynne Pearce,Polity,2007-01-05,"Romance Writing explores the changing nature of both the romance genre and the discourse of romantic love from the seventeenth century to the present day. Indeed, it is one of the first studies to approach romantic love as both genre and discourse in more than sixty years. Faced with the challenge of writing a cultural history for what is commonly understood to be one of lifes most universal, a-historical and cross-cultural phenomena, Lynne Pearce has invoked the concept of the gift to calculate loves added value at different cultural/historical moments. Building upon those philosophical traditions which have argued for the powerfully transformative nature of romantic love, Pearce shows how in the history of literature lovers have utilized its spark to change not only themselves, but also their worlds, through acts of creativity and heroism. The gift of love ranges from the simple gift of a name in the seventeenth century, through notions of immortality, self-sacrifice and selfhood in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, through to the liberating temporal and spatial dislocations of the postmodern age. The opening chapter, The Alchemy of Love, also undertakes an in-depth engagement of the changing nature, and meaning, of romantic love. Providing a judicious blend of close reading and cultural history, Romance Writing will be essential reading for undergraduate students as well as postgraduates and scholars working in the field, while also offering much of interest to the general reader.",0745630057,9780745630052,228,Language Arts & Disciplines,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=we4jl507M4EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=we4jl507M4EC&pg=PA32&dq=romance&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=we4jl507M4EC&dq=romance&hl=&source=gbs_api
The Romance of the Rose,"Guillaume de Lorris, Jean de Meun",Princeton University Press,1995-07-23,"Many English-speaking readers of the Roman de la rose, the famous dream allegory of the thirteenth century, have come to rely on Charles Dahlberg's elegant and precise translation of the Old French text. His line-by-line rendering in contemporary English is available again, this time in a third edition with an updated critical apparatus. Readers at all levels can continue to deepen their understanding of this rich tale about the Lover and his quest--against the admonishments of Reason and the obstacles set by Jealousy and Resistance--to pluck the fair Rose in the Enchanted Garden. The original introduction by Dahlberg remains an excellent overview of the work, covering such topics as the iconographic significance of the imagery and the use of irony in developing the central theme of love. His new preface reviews selected scholarship through 1990, which examines, for example, the sources and influences of the work, the two authors, the nature of the allegorical narrative as a genre, the use of first person, and the poem's early reception. The new bibliographic material incorporates that of the earlier editions. The sixty-four miniature illustrations from thirteenth-and fifteenth-century manuscripts are retained, as are the notes keyed to the Langlois edition, on which the translation is based.",0691044562,9780691044569,522,Literary Collections,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NFB-NgrsYqcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,3,1,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=NFB-NgrsYqcC&pg=PA11&dq=romance&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=NFB-NgrsYqcC&dq=romance&hl=&source=gbs_api

The Acquisition of Syntax in Romance Languages,"Vincent Torrens, Linda Escobar",John Benjamins Publishing,2006-01-01,"This volume includes a selection of papers that address a wide range of acquisition phenomena from different Romance languages and all share a common theoretical approach based on the Principles and Parameters theory.

They all depart from the view that language acquisition can be explained in terms of learning language specific rules, constraints or structures.

The Heroines of English Pastoral Romance,Sue P. Starke,Boydell & Brewer,2007,"The figure of the woman as hero in pastoral romance is shown to grow in importance and complexity in this important new study. The genre of pastoral romance flourished dramatically in Renaissance England between 1590 and 1650. One of its key elements is that it is the daughter, not the son, of the gentle family who increasingly becomes the subject of theromance's attempt to define and illustrate heroism. The pastoral heroine's task is paradoxical: to break out of her pastoral paradise in order to ensure its reconstitution. She is the princess, the shepherdess, the Lady, or the virtuous daughter who becomes a repository of honor and virtue in a changing society where traditional chivalric definitions of honor hold decreasing purchase. This groundbreaking book examines the typical challenges facedby the pastoral romance heroine as she matures within the pastoral locus amoenus: the foundling dilemma; the loop-shaped quest: the rhetorical battle; the chastity threat; the reconciliation of beauty to virtue; and familial reunification. It illustrates how the allegorical, symbolic, and psychological characterizations of pastoral heroines in the works of Sidney, Spenser, Wroth, Fletcher, Milton, and Marvell anticipate developments in the representation of female subjectivities normally associated with the novel.

STARKE is Associate Professor of English at Monmouth University, New Jersey.",184384124X,9781843841241,258,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PcRjnx6LuwwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=PcRjnx6LuwwC&pg=PA71&dq=romance&hl=&cd=10&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=PcRjnx6LuwwC&dq=romance&hl=&source=gbs_api

Subverting the Family Romance,Charlotte Daniels,Bucknell University Press,2000,"""Drawing on Habermas and Freud as well as historians of the family, Daniels takes up the case of three women novelists each writing at a key moment in the parallel development of the novel genre and the modern family. She demonstrates that these writers - confronted with ever more reified exclusion from public life, and relegated to narrowly defined domestic roles - intervened in and subverted the process in their novels. Daniels shows that women writers used the novel first to imagine different social rules that might define alternative kinship systems (Graffigny), and later to find - and create - loopholes within a firmly entrenched system of official and unofficial law (Charriere and Sand).""

The Family Romance of the French Revolution,Lynn Hunt,Univ of California Press,1992,"This latest work from an author known for her contributions to the new cultural history is a daring multidisciplinary investigation of the imaginative foundations of modern politics. ""Family romance"" was coined by Freud to describe the fantasy of being freed from one's family and belonging to one of higher social standing. In Freud's view, the family romance was a way for individuals to fantasize about their place in the social order. Hunt uses the term more broadly, to describe the images of the familial order underlying revolutionary politics. She investigates the narratives of family relations that structured the collective political unconscious. Most Europeans in the eighteenth century thought of their rulers as fathers and of their nations as families writ large. The French Revolution violently disrupted that patriarchal model of authority and raised troubling questions about what was to replace it. The king and queen were executed after dramatic separate trials. Prosecutors in the trial of the queen accused her of exerting undue influence on the king and his ministers, engaging in sexual debauchery, and even committing incest with her eight-year-old son. Hunt focuses on the meaning of killing the king-father and the queen-mother and what these ritual sacrifices meant to the establishment of a new model of politics. In a wide-ranging account that uses novels, engravings, paintings, speeches, newspaper editorials, pornographic writing, and revolutionary legislation about the family, Hunt shows that politics were experienced through the grid of the family romance.",0520082702,9780520082700,240,Biography & Autobiography,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JSpEn_SvVyAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=JSpEn_SvVyAC&pg=PR13&dq=romance&hl=&cd=18&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=JSpEn_SvVyAC&dq=romance&hl=&source=gbs_api

Vowel Length From Latin to Romance,Michele Loporcaro,OUP Oxford,2015-07-31,"This book investigates the changes that affected vowel length during the development of Latin into the Romance languages and dialects. In Latin, vowel length was contrastive (e.g. pila 'ball' vs. pila 'pile', like English bit vs. beat), but no modern Romance language has retained that same contrast. However, many non-standard Romance dialects (as well as French, up to the early 20th century) have developed novel vowel length contrasts, which are investigated in detail here. Unlike previous studies of this phenomenon, this book combines detailed historical evidence spanning three millennia (as attested by extant texts) with extensive data from present-day Romance varieties collected from first-hand fieldwork, which are subjected to both phonological and experimental phonetic analysis. Professor Loporcaro puts forward a detailed account of the loss of contrastive vowel length in late Latin, showing that this happened through the establishment of a process which lengthened all stressed vowels in open syllables, as in modern Italian casa ['ka:sa]. His analysis has implications for many of the most widely-debated issues relating to the origin of novel vowel length contrasts in Romance, which are also shown to have been preserved to different degrees in different areas. The detailed investigation of the rise and fall of vowel length in dozens of lesser-known (non-standard) varieties is crucial in understanding the development of this aspect of Romance historical phonology, and will be of interest not only to researchers and students in comparative Romance linguistics, but also, more generally, to phonologists and those interested in historical linguistics beyond the Latin-Romance language family.",0191630535,9780191630538,327,Language Arts & Disciplines,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-e8pCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=-e8pCgAAQBAJ&pg=PR7&dq=romance&hl=&cd=24&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-e8pCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api
Illustration in Fin-de-Siècle Transatlantic Romance Fiction,Kate Holterhoff,Routledge,2022-03-07,"This book examines illustrations created to accompany fictions written by several of the most popular authors published in Britain and America between 1885 and 1920. By studying the lavish illustrations that complemented not only initial serializations, but also subsequent publications of fictions by H. Rider Haggard, Rudyard Kipling, James De Mille, Robert Louis Stevenson, and H. G. Wells, the book demonstrates the significance of images to the fin de siècle romance form. In order to make fantastic plots seem possible, graphic artists worked hand in hand with authors to not only fill gaps in audience understanding, but also expand and deepen the meaning of these marvels. The book will be of interest to scholars working in art history, visual culture, illustration studies, British and American history, and British and American literature.",1000544656,9781000544657,263,Art,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2dNYEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=2dNYEAAAQBAJ&pg=PT7&dq=romance&hl=&cd=25&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2dNYEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Joseph Conrad and the Imperial Romance,L. Dryden,Springer,1999-11-24,"Linda Dryden places Almayer's Folly, An Outcast of the Islands , 'Karain', and Lord Jim in the context of the nineteenth-century imperial romance. Through the thwarted dreams and aspirations of his central characters she argues that Conrad exposes the empty promises of such fiction and challenges assumptions about the superiority of European imperialists and the imperial venture itself. Using illustrations from and references to many well-known novels of Empire, Dryden demonstrates how Conrad's Malay fiction alludes to the conventions and stereotypes of popular imperial fiction.",0230597076,9780230597075,239,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WnuJDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=WnuJDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA14&dq=romance&hl=&cd=28&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WnuJDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

A Romance of Two Worlds,Marie Corelli,N/A,1896,"""A Romance of Two Worlds starts with a young heroine, in first person, telling her story of a debilitating illness that includes depression and thoughts of suicide. Her doctor is unable to help her and sends her off on a holiday where she meets a mystical character by the name of Raffello Cellini, a famous Italian artist. Cellini offers her a strange potion which immediately puts her into a tranquil slumber, in which she experiences divine visions. Upon wakening, she craves more. Later, she meets her unnamed guardian angel, who whisks her through infinite solar systems faster than a shooting star while human spirits fly by like gossamer silk. He shares the truth of religion and the secret of human destiny, but still she longs for more. She comes to understand God as pure light and pure love, but it is not enough that she should see and hear these things from the touch of an angel. She wants to master this ability on her own and seeks a oneness with God through a series of meditative disciplines while locked away in a monastery.""--Wikipedia.",N/A,N/A,414,Healing,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-QFGAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=-QFGAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA330&dq=romance&hl=&cd=35&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-QFGAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api

Doggone Romance,Chris Keniston,Indie House Publishing,2018-01-22,"Welcome to Romance Virginia and the world of Main Street Romance. What's a flirt you ask? Think of them like an episode of a TV show bringing you snippets of life in your favorite romance world. A weekend road trip through the Blue Ridge Mountains is just the escape Kelly Harrison needs. Add in her best friend, a scenic overlook, an a cappella serenade from a popular country band, and the adventures are off to a grand start. Without a map or schedule, they can go anywhere, which is exactly what they do when Romance, Virginia, beckons. Thrilled to unplug from life's hectic demands, Rick Lambert can't think of a better way to relax than cruising the mountains of Virginia with his longtime Navy buddy. The only thing better? Sampling what’s known to be the best food on the Eastern seaboard in a town called Romance. The quaint small town promises a lazy afternoon in the sun, smiles and waves from passersby, and a bottomless pitcher of ice-cold sweet tea. But this picturesque location has its own special charm. With the resident fat cat and a couple of Great Danes, Romance is ready to turn Kelly and Rick’s worlds upside down.

Romance Revisited,"Lynne Pearce, Jackie Stacey",New York University Press,1995-10,"After decades of feminism and deconstruction, romance remains firmly in place as a central preoccupation in the lives of most women. Divorce rates skyrocket, the traditional family is challenged from all sides, and yet romance seems indestructible. In terms of its cultural representation, the popularity of romance also appears unchallenged. Popular fiction, Hollywood cinema, television soap-operas, and the media in general all display a seemingly bottomless appetite for romantic subjects. The trappings of classic romance—white weddings, love songs, Valentine's Day--are as commercially viable as ever. In this anthology of original essays, romance is revisited from a wide spectrum of perspectives, not just in fiction and film but in a whole range of cultural phenomena. Essays range over such issues as Valentine's Day, interracial relationships, medieval erotic visions and modern romance fiction, the relationship between the lesbian poet H.D. and Bryher, the pervasive whiteness of romantic desire, lesbian erotica in the age of AIDS, and the public romance of Charles and Diana.",N/A,N/A,320,Family & Relationships,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WegoAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=WegoAQAAIAAJ&q=romance&dq=romance&hl=&cd=105&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=WegoAQAAIAAJ&dq=romance&hl=&source=gbs_api

The Alexander Romance,"Krzysztof Nawotka, Agnieszka Wojciechowska",Barkhuis,2018-10-22,"The Alexander Romance is a difficult text to define and to assess justly. From its earliest days it was an open text, which was adapted into a variety of cultures with meanings that themselves vary, and yet seem to carry a strong undercurrent of homogeneity: Alexander is the hero who cannot become a god, and who encapsulates the desires and strivings of the host cultures. The papers assembled in this volume, which were originally presented at a conference at the University of Wroc?aw, Poland, in October 2015, all face the challenge of defining the Alexander Romance. Some focus on quite specific topics while others address more overarching themes. They form a cohesive set of approaches to the delicate positioning of the text between history and literature. From its earliest elements in Hellenistic Egypt, to its latest reworkings in the Byzantine and Islamic Middle East, the Alexander Romance shows itself to be a work that steadily engages with such questions as kingship, the limits of human (and Greek) nature, and the purpose of history. The Romance began as a history, but only by becoming literature could it achieve such a deep penetration of east and west.",9492444739,9789492444738,339,Fiction,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=52N6DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=52N6DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=romance&hl=&cd=114&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=52N6DwAAQBAJ&dq=romance&hl=&source=gbs_api

Spanish Romance in the Battle for Global Supremacy,Victoria Muñoz,Anthem Press,2021-01-19,"Did Spanish explorers really discover the sunken city of Atlantis or one of the lost tribes of Israel in Aztec México? Did classical writers foretell the discovery of America? Were faeries and Amazons hiding in Guiana, and where was the fabled golden city, El Dorado? Who was more powerful, Apollo or Diana, and which claimant nation, Spain or England, would win the game of empire? These were some of the questions English writers, historians, and polemicists asked through their engagement with Spanish romance. By exploring England’s fanatical consumption of these tales of love and arms as reflected in the works of Edmund Spenser, William Shakespeare, John Dryden, Ben Jonson, and Peter Heylyn, this book shows how the idea of English empire took root in and through literature, and how these circumstances primed the success of Miguel de Cervantes's Don Quixote of la Mancha in England.",1785273310,9781785273315,244,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3G8WEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=3G8WEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=romance&hl=&cd=125&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=3G8WEAAAQBAJ&dq=romance&hl=&source=gbs_api

Transformation,Nathaniel Hawthorne,N/A,2020-09-29,"The Marble Faun: Or, The Romance of Monte Beni, also known by the British title Transformation, was the last of the four major romances by Nathaniel Hawthorne, and was published in 1860. The Marble Faun, written on the eve of the American Civil War, is set in a fantastical Italy. The romance mixes elements of a fable, pastoral, gothic novel, and travel guide. This romance focuses on four main characters: Miriam, Hilda, Kenyon, and Donatello. Miriam is a beautiful painter with an unknown past. Throughout the novel, she is compared to many other women including Eve, Beatrice Cenci, Judith, and Cleopatra. Miriam is pursued by a mysterious, threatening man who is her ""evil genius"" through life. Hilda is an innocent copyist. She is compared to the Virgin Mary and the white dove. Her simple, unbendable moral principles can make her severe in spite of her tender heart. Miriam and Hilda are often contrasted. Kenyon is a sculptor who represents rationalist humanism. He cherishes a romantic affection towards Hilda. Donatello, the Count of Monte Beni, is often compared to Adam and is in love with Miriam. Donatello amazingly resembles the marble Faun of Praxiteles, and the novel plays with the characters' belief that the Count may be a descendant of the antique Faun. Hawthorne, however, withholds a definite statement even in the novel's concluding chapters and postscript.",9390312639,9789390312634,200,N/A,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3hWfzQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=3hWfzQEACAAJ&dq=romance&hl=&cd=134&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=3hWfzQEACAAJ&dq=romance&hl=&source=gbs_api

The Crusader's Heart,Claire Delacroix,Deborah A. Cooke,2015-10-20,"Wulfe knew his place—until Christina taught him to hope for more... An orphan and a man who has fought for his own survival, Wulfe is a Templar knight sworn to the order for life. He will defend the order and his brethren to his last, but protests when he is included in a mission to deliver a package to Paris on the cusp of an attack on Jerusalem. The assignment so vexes him so that he seeks distraction in a Venetian brothel. Wulfe does not expect to encounter a courtesan of beauty and wit, her appeal for his assistance—much less his own desire to fulfill her request... Christina recognizes immediately that the grim knight offers the chance to escape a despised life and reclaim her legacy. All she has to do is convince Wulfe to accompany her out of the city, a challenge that demands more than the power of her touch—when Wulfe is attacked, she seizes the opportunity to prove her value to him and his quest, uncertain whether her wits will be sufficient. As attacks mount and danger engulfs the small company, Christina is the one who guesses the contents of the Templar package—and holds the key to its successful delivery. Wulfe is shocked to realize that she has awakened the heart he forgot he possessed—and when she risks herself to see his mission completed, he must choose between his duty and his newfound love... * * * The Champions of St. Euphemia series follows the quest of a group of knights entrusted with a treasure in Jerusalem which they must deliver safely to Paris on their way to their respective homes. They find adventure and peril on the way, as well as romance. Since the stories overlap and build upon each other, they should be read in order. 1. The Crusader's Bride 2. The Crusader's Heart 3.

THE TROUBLE WITH DUKES: They call him the Duke of Murder. The gossips whisper that the new Duke of Murdoch is a brute, a murderer, and even worse--a Scot. They say he should never be trusted alone with a woman. But Megan Windham sees in Hamish something different, someone different. TOO SCOT TO HANDLE As a captain in the army, Colin MacHugh led men, fixed what was broken, and fought hard.

Hyperion,Henry W. Longfellow,Mint Editions,2021-03-09,"Hyperion: A Romance (1839) is a novel by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Although he is known predominately as one of the leading American poets of the nineteenth century, Longfellow began his career writing moderately successful travelogues, stories, and novels. Inspired by his travels throughout Europe, as well as by the death of his first wife, Longfellow published Hyperion: A Romance to lukewarm critical response. Although less significant than his lyric and epic poetry, Hyperion captures an artist coming into his own within a Romantic tradition flooded with major and minor figures across the globe. Modeled partly on Goethe's Wilhelm Meister's Lehrjahre (1796), Hyperion: A Romance is the story of Paul Flemming, a young academic who travels to Germany following the loss of a close friend. Taking in the sights, sounds, folk tales, and music of the countryside, towns, and villages he visits, Flemming muses on the position of humanity in the world and the meaning of art in relation to nature. Filled with such lofty thoughts, he is entirely unprepared to meet and fall in love with a German woman. At a moment of growth and on the brink of reconciling with his trauma, Flemming attempts to offer himself to another only to find that life has a strange way of reflecting the mind of the artist. Hyperion: A Romance is a fascinating blend of travel narrative, philosophy, and bildungsroman from a writer with a poet's sense of the world. With a beautifully designed cover and professionally typeset manuscript, this edition of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's Hyperion: A Romance is a classic of American literature reimagined for modern readers.",1513278347,9781513278346,208,Fiction,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RrdTzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=RrdTzgEACAAJ&dq=romance&hl=&cd=142&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=RrdTzgEACAAJ&dq=romance&hl=&source=gbs_api

A Romance of Two Worlds,Marie Corelli,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,2018-07-03,"A romance of two worlds , By Marie Corelli ( first novel )by Marie Corelli A Romance of Two Worlds starts with a young heroine, in first person, telling her story of a debilitating illness that includes depression and thoughts of suicide. Her doctor is unable to help her and sends her off on a holiday where she meets a mystical character by the name of Raffello Cellini, a famous Italian artist. Cellini offers her a strange potion which immediately puts her into a tranquil slumber, in which she experiences divine visions. Upon wakening, she craves more. Later, she meets her unnamed guardian angel, who whisks her through infinite solar systems faster than a shooting star while human spirits fly by like gossamer silk. He shares the truth of religion and the secret of human destiny, but still she longs for more. She comes to understand God as pure light and pure love, but it's not enough that she should see and hear these things from the touch of an angel. She wants to master this ability on her own and seeks a oneness with God through a series of meditative disciplines while locked away in a monastery. Reception--The novel was rejected for publication by Hall Caine-an act that began a lifelong feud between Caine and Corelli. After hearing of Caine's harsh criticism, George Bentley suspected that the novel might have commercial appeal and published Corelli's first novel.We are delighted to publish this classic book as part of our extensive Classic Library collection.

But a dazzling virgin—who just happened to be the Elizabeth I, the Queen of England—tricked Mikhail and stole the jewels. But now he has a chance at redemption. The jewels have been found five centuries later. The only problem is they’ve been turned over to gemologist, Piper Linwood.

Transformation,Nathaniel Hawthorne,N/A,2020-07-28,"The Marble Faun: Or, The Romance of Monte Beni, also known by the British title Transformation, was the last of the four major romances by Nathaniel Hawthorne, and was published in 1860. The Marble Faun, written on the eve of the American Civil War, is set in a fantastical Italy. The romance mixes elements of a fable, pastoral, gothic novel, and travel guide. This romance focuses on four main characters: Miriam, Hilda, Kenyon, and Donatello. Miriam is a beautiful painter with an unknown past. Throughout the novel, she is compared to many other women including Eve, Beatrice Cenci, Judith, and Cleopatra. Miriam is pursued by a mysterious, threatening man who is her ""evil genius"" through life. Hilda is an innocent copyist. She is compared to the Virgin Mary and the white dove. Her simple, unbendable moral principles can make her severe in spite of her tender heart. Miriam and Hilda are often contrasted. Kenyon is a sculptor who represents rationalist humanism. He cherishes a romantic affection towards Hilda. Donatello, the Count of Monte Beni, is often compared to Adam and is in love with Miriam. Donatello amazingly resembles the marble Faun of Praxiteles, and the novel plays with the characters' belief that the Count may be a descendant of the antique Faun. Hawthorne, however, withholds a definite statement even in the novel's concluding chapters and postscript.",9390195764,9789390195763,0,N/A,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=m3SEzwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=m3SEzwEACAAJ&dq=romance&hl=&cd=154&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=m3SEzwEACAAJ&dq=romance&hl=&source=gbs_api

Paen Gerville longed for a lively, well-rounded woman, one whose plump breast would cushion his head after the lonely, harsh life of a solitary fighting knight. At first his wife-to-be promised no such delights - her form was unbending, her health apparently fragile as she fainted into his arms after their first kiss.

Cipher,Jane G. Austin,Forgotten Books,2017-12-21,"Excerpt from Cipher: A Romance The clerk whom he addressed paused a moment in his occupation of can celling the stamps upon a mountain of outward-bound letters and glanced at the one in the hand of the carrier.

Let's see what he'll say to it, remarked the carrier, crossing the office and approaching another table covered with letters and packages, where stood a middle-aged man, with stooping shoulders and the sallow complexion peculiar to men and plants grown in the shade. He was busy in folding small parcels of the letters before him in wrappers, announcing their contents at the same time in a voice whose sonorous sweetness contrasted even grotesquely with his appearance, while a clerk Opposite rapidly entered the list thus dictated in a large volume, and two assistants tied and backed or docketed the little packages.

Comparative Historical Dialectology,Thomas D. Cravens,John Benjamins Publishing,2002-09-05,"This brief monograph explores the historical motivations for two sets of phonological changes in some varieties of Romance: restructured voicing of intervocalic /p t k/, and palatalization of initial /l/ and /n/. These developments have been treated repeatedly over the decades, yet neither has enjoyed a satisfactory solution. This book attempts to demonstrate that both outcomes are ultimately attributable to the loss of early pan-Romance consonant gemination. This study is of interest not only to the language-specific field of historical Romance linguistics, but also to general historical linguistics. The central problems examined here constitute classic cases of questions that cannot be answered by confining analysis solely to the individual languages under investigation. The passage of time, the indirect nature of fragmentary and accidental documentation, and the nature of the changes themselves conspire to deny access to the most essential facts. However, comparison of closely cognate languages now undergoing change supplies a perspective for discerning conditions that may ultimately lead to states achieved in the distant past by the languages under investigation.",9027275394,9789027275394,177,Language Arts & Disciplines,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5UA6AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=5UA6AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=romance&hl=&cd=164&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5UA6AAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

The Romance of the Rose and the Making of Fourteenth-Century English Literature,Philip Knox,Oxford University Press,2022-02-17,"The Romance of the Rose had a transformative effect on the multilingual literary culture of fourteenth-century England, leaving more material evidence for late medieval English-speaking readers than any other vernacular literary work from mainland Europe. This book examines its decisive effect on English literature of the fourteenth century, and new literary experiments it provoked from writers such as Geoffrey Chaucer, John Gower, William Langland, and the author of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. Linking the English afterlife of the Rose to a host of ongoing cultural developments in mainland Europe, The Romance of the Rose and the Making of Fourteenth-Century English Literature reveals the deep interconnectedness of English and European literary culture. Examining courtly, clerical, and classicising orientations towards the text, it presents new arguments for the place of the Rose at the centre of fourteenth-century English literature, and explores its rich manuscript history to reveal new evidence about the cultural significance of this love allegory from thirteenth-century France. The chapters avoid an author-centred approach, arranging readings of the Rose and its relation with English literature in constellations that reveal complex unfolding inter-relation of the diverse readings of the Rose that took place in fourteenth-century England.",0192662872,9780192662873,443,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Gp1cEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=Gp1cEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=romance&hl=&cd=166&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Gp1cEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

The Viper of Milan,Marjorie Bowen,Pantianos Classics,1906,"The Viper of Milan depicts 14th century Italy as a place of danger and fractious warfare, as disparate groups of nobles fought to achieve and maintain supremacy. A novel steeped in darkness and conflict, we are plunged into the rivalries which rend the province of Lombardy in the early Renaissance. That the reader be immersed, Marjorie Bowen researched the period extensively, noting the rise of the Visconti family who would dominate Milan for decades. Although this novel is not historically accurate, its general depiction of Italian society and nobility of the time - of its priorities, cruelties and caprices - is founded in factual incidents. Marjorie Bowen specialized in historical romances, publishing over a hundred fictional works set in a variety of time periods and locales, together with several biographies of famous figures of yore. Often they contain a romantic element, alongside a gothic or dark aspect; such idiosyncrasy made Bowen a favorite of authors such as Graham Greene. The Viper of Milan, which appeared in 1906, is her earliest published work, the warm reception spurring the young author to further writing.",N/A,N/A,398,Fiction,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0h5FAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=0h5FAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=romance&hl=&cd=175&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0h5FAAAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api
St. Irvyne; Or the Rosicrucian,Percy Bysshe Shelley,Mint Editions,2021-05-21,"St. Irvyne; or, The Rosicrucian: A Romance (1811) is a novel by Percy Bysshe Shelley. Although he is commonly regarded as a leading Romantic poet, Shelley published this Gothic horror tale at the beginning of his career while an undergraduate at the University of Oxford. Controversial for its violent themes and exploration of the darker side of human consciousness, St. Irvyne; or, The Rosicrucian: A Romance remains an important early work of Shelley's and continues to inform scholars of the Romantic style to this day. Left with nowhere to go, Wolfstein turns to the treacherous slopes of the Swiss Alps, where he contemplates suicide and rages against the ills of society. During a thunderstorm, he takes shelter and encounters a band of monks. As they prepare to take him in, a group of bandits attacks, seizing what they can and forcing Wolfstein to follow them to their underground lair. There, he meets Megalena, a beautiful captive. Soon, he overhears a guard sing a chilling song about a woman named Rosa, Wolfstein fears that their lives are in grave danger. He manages to poison Cavigni, their leader, and escapes with Megalena through the mountains. They settle in Genoa, where they attempt to return to a sense of normalcy. When another woman comes between the two lovers, Wolfstein is forced to make a fateful decision. St. Irvyne; or, The Rosicrucian: A Romance is a novel of romance, terror, and the supernatural by a leading writer of English Romanticism.

Manual of Romance Phonetics and Phonology,"Christoph Gabriel, Randall Gess, Trudel Meisenburg",de Gruyter,2020-09-16,"This handbook is structured in two parts: it provides, on the one hand, a comprehensive (synchronic) overview of the phonetics and phonology (including prosody) of a breadth of Romance languages and focuses, on the other hand, on central topics of research in Romance segmental and suprasegmental phonology, including comparative and diachronic perspectives. Phonetics and Phonology have always been a core discipline in Romance linguistics: the wide synchronic variety of languages and dialects derived from spoken Latin is extensively explored in numerous corpus and atlas projects, and for quite a few of these varieties there is also more or less ample documentation of at least some of their diachronic stages. This rich empirical database offers excellent testing grounds for different theoretical approaches and allows for substantial insights into phonological structuring as well as into (incipient, ongoing, or concluded) processes of phonological change. The volume can be read both as a state-of-the-art report of research in the field and as a manual of Romance languages with special emphasis on the key topics of phonetics and phonology.",3110548356,9783110548358,600,Language Arts & Disciplines,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4gRutAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=4gRutAEACAAJ&dq=romance&hl=&cd=178&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=4gRutAEACAAJ&dq=romance&hl=&source=gbs_api

Mistletoe Madness What Eve wanted for Christmas was a dancing naked Santa. What she got was her best friend falling in love with her. Radio talk show host, Eve Kingston, would have said her neighbor down the street was one of her best friends in the world. After a simple kiss under the mistletoe, Sam now says he wants to sleep with her. Eve thinks maybe she wants to see Sam dancing naked in a Santa hat. Madness has obviously taken over both of them. Will either of them get their crazy wish for Christmas? Saving Santa Her Marine training hadn’t quite prepared her for saving St. Nick Like all bad deeds, her nickname for Nicolas North had finally come back to bite her on the butt. The too nice man she admired was determined to play Santa for the local Christmas parade while some shooting stalker was out there after him. For a geek, the man could nearly kiss the hard-ass Marine right out of her. Only she couldn’t let him. At least not until she’d managed to save Santa.

My wedding with Robbie was only a week away, and our rocky relationship was already on edge. Even though it was a bad time to go back, I couldn’t resist the chance to visit my best friend—both to sort out my own feelings and escape from Robbie’s increasingly controlling behavior. Never could I have imagined how this quick trip and an innocent night of freedom could have spiraled out of control. Meeting Nathan wasn’t supposed to happen, and I definitely wasn’t supposed to kiss him. But he was so kind and sexy, and it was so nice to feel wanted for once. But, as soon as I came to my senses and ran from our kiss, I bumped into the one person I never expected. My trip away is now a harbor of secrets, created by those close to me, and my new found taste for freedom. Nathan When I saw Julia watching me at the bar, I felt something I hadn’t felt in years. When I kissed her, I knew she was meant to be mine. But this Robbie guy she was with, he seemed to have some pull over her, something I couldn’t understand.

The Happily Ever After,Avi Steinberg,Nan A. Talese,2020-08-11,"A memoir about writing a novel about searching for love. Is romance dead? Is that why there are so many vampires in today's romance novels? When Avi Steinberg's love life took a grim turn, he did what he always does: He consulted his old books, the usual cast of Great (Very Serious, Usually Male) Authors. And he immediately realized that these books were part of the problem. Instead, he began to read romances, the books he--like so many of us--have been conditioned to dismiss as ""trashy."" What he discovered was a genre that was tremendously diverse and daring, along with a vast network of innovative writers who were keeping the novel as alive as ever. His own relationship problems, he realized, came down to a failure of his imagination. And so he set out on a quest to write and publish a romance novel and to find real-life love. A hybrid of memoir, travelogue, and critical essay, The Happily Ever After chronicles an adventure in a brave new world of literature. Steinberg offers a report from the trenches of romance, moving between major industry conferences and writing groups at the local bar as he works and reworks his romance novel idea. He reveals the inside scoop from a major romance publishing house, crisscrosses the country meeting mysterious ghostwriters and Fabio's great unsung rival, and offers a running take on the fascinating history of romance writing, the genre that invented, and continues to reinvent, the modern novel. Along the way he meets many readers, each of whom sheds light on why we are so fascinated by--and phobic of--romance fiction and what the vitality and fractiousness of our biggest genre says about us.

Lord Brookton,Gianna Thomas,N/A,2016-04-08,"Jules Lagrant, Lord Brookton, may be the least handsome of the four lords, but he is the most popular with the ladies in London for his prowess in the bedroom. He is also the most temperamental and debauched of the four lords. Irritated that the friendship of the four young men has been broken up by the marriages of Lord Windmere and Lord Weirlane, he is finding that life is not as satisfying as it had been when carousing with his friends.

Desert Passions,Hsu-Ming Teo,University of Texas Press,2012-11-15,"The Sheik—E. M. Hull’s best-selling novel that became a wildly popular film starring Rudolph Valentino—kindled “sheik fever” across the Western world in the 1920s. A craze for all things romantically “Oriental” swept through fashion, film, and literature, spawning imitations and parodies without number. While that fervor has largely subsided, tales of passion between Western women and Arab men continue to enthrall readers of today’s mass-market romance novels. In this groundbreaking cultural history, Hsu-Ming Teo traces the literary lineage of these desert romances and historical bodice rippers from the twelfth to the twenty-first century and explores the gendered cultural and political purposes that they have served at various historical moments. Drawing on “high” literature, erotica, and popular romance fiction and films, Teo examines the changing meanings of Orientalist tropes such as crusades and conversion, abduction by Barbary pirates, sexual slavery, the fear of renegades, the Oriental despot and his harem, the figure of the powerful Western concubine, and fantasies of escape from the harem. She analyzes the impact of imperialism, decolonization, sexual liberation, feminism, and American involvement in the Middle East on women’s Orientalist fiction. Teo suggests that the rise of female-authored romance novels dramatically transformed the nature of Orientalism because it feminized the discourse; made white women central as producers, consumers, and imagined actors; and revised, reversed, or collapsed the binaries inherent in traditional analyses of Orientalism.",0292739400,9780292739406,355,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=y7XK0xu4IaMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=y7XK0xu4IaMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=romance&hl=&cd=204&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=y7XK0xu4IaMC&source=gbs_api
The Spanish House,Cherry Radford,Bloomsbury Publishing,2021-07-12,"'5 stars An absolutely delightful and captivating read!' – Lucy Coleman, bestselling author of Summer in Andalucia 'A delightful, romantic and moving adventure. I enjoyed every moment... A delicious slice of golden escapism.' – Louise Douglas, bestselling author of The House by the Sea One bizarre to-do list to earn her inheritance. One Spanish summer. One huge family secret. Juliana makes a modest living as an 'ethnic' TV/film extra – even though the only connections with her Spanish heritage are her cacti, Spanish classes, and some confused memories of a Spanish mother she hasn't seen since she was seven. When her beloved Uncle Arturo offers her the chance to discover her roots while housesitting his coastal home in a quiet corner of Andalusia, Juliana can't believe her luck. Especially when he reveals that the house will be hers if she fulfils ten life-enhancing 'Conditions' within 90 days. Redecoration of the house and a visit to the old film studio where her mother used to sew costumes seem ridiculously simple tasks for such a wonderful reward. But little does Juliana realise that there are family secrets and inherited rivalries awaiting her in sunny Spain, and the condition that she has to 'get on with the neighbours' – who include a ruggedly handsome but moody artist – may be harder than she thinks. The perfect escapist read for fans of Rosanna Ley, Jo Thomas and Sue Moorcroft. Readers love The Spanish House!

Women and Romance,Laurie Langbauer,N/A,2018-08-15,"According to Laurie Langbauer, the notion of romance is vague precisely because it represents the chaotic negative space outside the novel that determines its form. Addressing questions of form, Langbauer reads novels that explore the interplay between the novel and romance: works by Charlotte Lennox, Mary Wollstonecraft, Charles Dickens, George Eliot, and George Meredith. She considers key issues in feminist debate, in particular the relations of feminist to the poststructuralist theories of Lacan, Derrida, and Foucault. In highlighting questions of gender in this way, Women and Romance contributes to a major debate between skeptical and materialist points of view among poststructuralist critics.",1501728008,9781501728006,0,English fiction,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=M8dMtAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=M8dMtAEACAAJ&dq=romance&hl=&cd=212&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=M8dMtAEACAAJ&dq=romance&hl=&source=gbs_api

The Last Egyptian - A Romance Of The Nile,L. Frank Baum,Jazzybee Verlag,2014-04-07,"An Egyptian romance of the present time, full of the charm of the land of the Nile and dramatic in plot and setting. The book is a most creditable romance vibrant with human nature and the mystery and fascination of the East. A young Englishman, with an abundant fortune and a passion for Egyptology, visits the village of Al-Kusiyeh because of the rumor that ancient arms and jewels had come from the Sheik. There he meets Kara, the lineal descendant of the great Athka-Ra and grandson of Princess Hatatcha, who, at seventeen, captivated London and Lord Roane, who divorced his wife for her sake, but whom she refused to marry. Their daughter was Kara's mother. Lord Roan's grand-daughter was the one unselfish, honest love of his life, and he and his dissolute son are given government positions in Cairo, where the Englishman and Kara both meet, and wish to marry the grand-daughter. Jealousy, treachery, plot and counterplot are thrown against a background of ancient custom and belief. It is a story of a vendetta, in which an Egyptian prince—to avenge the wrong of his grandmother—pits himself against the love of an Englishman for the possession of the woman who is by blood his cousin.",3849643719,9783849643713,208,Fiction,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=a_NGAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=a_NGAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=romance&hl=&cd=217&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=a_NGAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Providing fresh insight into the development of the novel, this study identifies the politicisation of erotic romance by the European philhellene (lovers of all things Greek) Protestant movement. To English translators and authors, the complex plots, well developed moralised characters (particularly female) and rhetorical styles of the ancient novels signify political and social reform. Generous quotation and translations ensure that European Erotic Romance is accessible to a broad spectrum of readers. Its organisation lends itself to use as a course text.

Haven Point Volume 1,RaeAnne Thayne,HQN Books,2019-07-15,"New York Times bestselling author RaeAnne Thayne introduces you back to Haven Point—a place made for second chances… Snow Angel Cove Nothing short of a miracle can restore Eliza Hayward’s Christmas cheer. The job she pinned her dreams on has gone up in smoke—literally—and now she’s stuck in an unfamiliar, if breathtaking, small town. Precariously close to being destitute, Eliza needs a hero, but she’s not expecting one who almost runs her down with his car! Rescuing Eliza is pure instinct for tech genius Aidan Caine. At first, putting the renovation of his lakeside guest lodge in Eliza’s hands assuages his guilt—until he sees how quickly he could fall for her. Having focused solely on his business for years, he never knew what his life was missing before Eliza, but now he’s willing to risk his heart on a yuletide romance that could lead to forever. Redemption Bay McKenzie Shaw would do anything for her hometown of Haven Point. It may be small, but it’s never let her down…unlike gorgeous, infuriating Ben Kilpatrick.

For Haven Point’s sake, McKenzie has to grit her teeth and play nice. What could a town filled with painful memories ever offer Ben? Yet seeing the town through the eyes of McKenzie—its fiery young mayor—he suddenly has his answer. If only he can resolve the animosity crackling between them, Ben may have found the place where he can build ties and find healing…a place where love arrives when it’s least expected.",1488057338,9781488057335,678,Fiction,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=X6iTDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=X6iTDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=romance&hl=&cd=239&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=X6iTDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Stories Set Forth with Fair Words,Marianne E. Kalinke,N/A,2017,"This book is an investigation of the foundation and evolution of romance in Iceland. The narrative type arose from the introduction of French narratives into the alien literary environment of Iceland and the acculturation of the import to indigenous literary traditions. The study focuses on the oldest Icelandic copies of three chansons de geste and four of the earliest indigenous romances, both types transmitted in an Icelandic codex from around 1300. The impact of the translated epic poems on the origin and development of the Icelandic romances was considerable, yet they have been largely neglected by scholars in favour of the courtly romances. This study attests the role played by the epic poems in the composition of romance in Iceland, which introduced the motifs of the aggressive female wooer and of Christian-heathen conflict. --",1786830671,9781786830678,0,"Romances, Old Norse",en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NlBRAQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=NlBRAQAACAAJ&dq=romance&hl=&cd=246&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=NlBRAQAACAAJ&dq=romance&hl=&source=gbs_api

The Romance of a Shop,Amy Levy,Mint Editions,2026-08-14,"The Romance of a Shop (1888) is a novel by Amy Levy. Published the year before her tragic death, The Romance of a Shop is the debut novel of a pioneering writer and feminist whose poetry and prose explores the concept of the New Woman while illuminating the realities of Jewish life in nineteenth century London. ""The air of desolation which hung about the house had communicated itself in some vague manner to the garden, where the trees were bright with blossom, or misty with the tender green of the young leaves. Perhaps the effect of sadness was produced, or at least heightened, by the pathetic figure that paced slowly up and down the gravel path immediately before the house; the figure of a young woman, slight, not tall, bare-headed, and clothed in deep mourning."" Following the unexpected death of their father, sisters Fanny, Gertrude, Lucy, and Phyllis are left with little inheritance and even less hope for the future. On the brink of despair, they join together to launch a photography business, each contributing to the best of their abilities in order to survive. As Lucy begins an apprenticeship with a local photographer, her sisters purchase and prepare their own studio for her return. Despite their efforts, they struggle to convince customers that a shop owned by women can demand the same prices as those run by men. Through perseverance and luck, however, the Lorimers find success as funeral photographers and through their connection to a prominent artist. As romance, illness, and war interrupt their plans, the sisters find solace in their mutual resolve to not only survive, but provide and care for one another. With a beautifully designed cover and professionally typeset manuscript, this edition Amy Levy's The Romance of a Shop is a classic work of British literature reimagined for modern readers.",1513295810,9781513295817,156,Fiction,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YJKazgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=YJKazgEACAAJ&dq=romance&hl=&cd=252&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=YJKazgEACAAJ&dq=romance&hl=&source=gbs_api
"Ivanhoe, A Romance Annotated",Walter Scott,N/A,2021-02-19,"Ivanhoe is a historical novel by Sir Walter Scott, first published in late 1819 in three volumes and subtitled A Romance. At the time it was written it represented a shift by Scott away from fairly realistic novels set in Scotland in the comparatively recent past, to a somewhat fanciful depiction of medieval England.It has proved to be one of the best known and most influential of Scott's novels.Ivanhoe is set in 12th-century England with colourful descriptions of a tournament, outlaws, a witch trial and divisions between Jews and Christians.It has been credited for increasing interest in romance and medievalism; John Henry Newman claimed Scott ""had first turned men's minds in the direction of the Middle Ages"", while Thomas Carlyle and John Ruskin made similar assertions of Scott's overwhelming influence over the revival, based primarily on the publication of this novel.It has also had an important influence on popular perceptions of Richard the Lionheart, King John and Robin Hood.",N/A,9798711475736,774,N/A,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rUNrzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=rUNrzgEACAAJ&dq=romance&hl=&cd=253&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=rUNrzgEACAAJ&dq=romance&hl=&source=gbs_api

Discovering she was the illegitimate daughter of the prince of Chantaine took some getting used to—especially when she was working as a nanny on a Texas ranch! As much as she tried to focus on caring for baby Emma, her newfound fame kept getting in the way. Until help arrived from an unexpected—and handsome—source… Widowed rancher Benjamin Garner would do anything for his daughter—even fake an engagement to Coco to keep the paparazzi at bay.

Romance and Sex in Adolescence and Emerging Adulthood,"Ann C. Crouter, Alan Booth",Psychology Press,2006,"In this volume, Romance and Sex in Adolescence and Emerging Adulthood: Risks and Opportunities, top scholars in the field of family research examine the nature and origin of adolescents’ contemporary patterns of sexual and romantic relationships, spanning such diverse topics as the evolutionary roots of these behaviors, as well as policies and programs that represent best practices for addressing these issues in schools and communities. The text offers interdisciplinary expertise from scholars of psychology, social work, sociology, demography, economics, human development and family studies, and public policy. Adolescents and young adults today face very different choices about family formation than did their parents’ generation, given such societal changes as the rise in cohabitation, the increase in divorce rates, and families having fewer children. These demographic trends are linked in important ways and provide a backdrop against which adolescents and emerging adults form and maintain romantic and sexual relationships. Editors Crouter and Booth address such questions as: *What are the ways in which early family and peer relationships give rise to romantic relationships in the late adolescent and early adult years? *How do early romantic and sexual relationships influence individuals’ subsequent development and life choices, including family formation? *To what extent are current trends in romantic and sexual relationships in adolescence and emerging adulthood problematic for individuals, families, and communities, and what are the most effective ways to address these issues at the level of practice, program, and policy? Romance and Sex in Adolescence and Emerging Adulthood: Risks and Opportunities is an enlightening compilation of essays for academicians and upper-lever undergraduate and graduate students in the fields of human development and family studies, sociology, and psychology, as well as for practitioners in those fields who work with families and adolescents.

She pushes me up against the wall and we kiss harder than we ever have before. I've been waiting so long for it to happen, and finally, it's going to. Then the bedroom door flies open, and someone screams her name... Britton Walsh has never had a home. After a lifetime in the care system, she doesn't expect she'll ever find one. But beginning her senior year with new foster parents in a new city, means starting over yet again. Tom and Cate Cahill seem okay. The hitch? Their daughter, Avery. Beautiful, popular and cool, Avery is everything Britton is not. She's all Britton could ever ask for in a sister, or even a friend--but having survived without either for so long, Britton knows the way her heart races whenever Avery enters the room can only mean one thing... But Avery has a secret. Something that is eating away at her and stopping her letting anyone in, least of all Britton. Will Avery's insistence on punishing herself for a mistake in her past make Britton's last year of high school, and finding a place to call home, impossible?

Cultural Difference and Material Culture in Middle English Romance,Dominique Battles,Routledge,2013-09-13,"This book explores how the cultural distinctions and conflicts between Anglo-Saxons and Normans originating with the Norman Conquest of 1066 prevailed well into the fourteenth century and are manifest in a significant number of Middle English romances including King Horn, Havelok the Dane, Sir Orfeo, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, and others. Specifically, the study looks at how the material culture of these poems (architecture, battle tactic, landscapes) systematically and persistently distinguishes between Norman and Anglo-Saxon cultural identity. Additionally, it examines the influence of the English Outlaw Tradition, itself grounded in Anglo-Saxon resistance to the Norman Conquest, as expressed in specific recurring scenes (disguise and infiltration, forest exile) found in many Middle English romances. In the broadest sense, a significant number of Middle English romances, including some of the most well-read and often-taught, set up a dichotomy of two ruling houses headed by a powerful lord, who compete for power and influence. This book examines the cultural heritage behind each of these pairings to show how poets repeatedly contrast essentially Norman and Anglo-Saxon values and ruling styles.",1136156631,9781136156632,234,Architecture,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wTzaAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=wTzaAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=romance&hl=&cd=282&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wTzaAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

The Romance of a Midshipman (Classic Reprint),William Clark Russell,N/A,2015-06-29,"Excerpt from The Romance of a Midshipman I was at Bouville, a little dusky seaport situated on the French coast betwixt Brest and placid old Calais. One long pier strikes fang-like with a flash into the breaches of the sea and the wild play of foam makes a light for that gray and gloomy harbor. The gloom is in the black timbers of pier, in the dark green sheathing of seaweed, in an appearance of darkness in the water where it spreads its inmost extremity. Bouville is full of churches. It may be that in my time you might count one for every hundred head of man and woman. Better for the inhabitants if their spires were of commerce, and smoked; but the weather-cock darts a flame as it revolves, and is an ornament in the air. The harbor is the pleasantest part. I always thought it so when a boy. I was fascinated by the clumsy black smacks, and their huge chocolate lugs, and their deck-loads of gabbling, sprawling men, and noisy, gesticulating women, in immense caps and shining earrings. These poor people are very devout. About the Publisher Forgotten Books publishes hundreds of thousands of rare and classic books.

Talking Dirty on Sex and the City,Beatriz Oria,Rowman & Littlefield,2014-06-05,"First broadcast on HBO in 1998, Sex and the City quickly became a mainstream success. Following four women who navigate the promise and peril of social, political, and sexual relationships in New York, the series caused a stir in the popular media. Academia also responded with a remarkable body of criticism for such an apparently trivial program. But more than ten years after the show ended, there is still much more to say about this cultural phenomenon that spawned two film sequels. In Talking Dirty on Sex and the City: Romance, Intimacy, Friendship, Beatriz Oria explores the discourses surrounding the series from a sociological point of view. Specifically, this book focuses on the conventions of the romantic comedy genre and how its familiar fictional world articulates issues of intimacy, gender identity, and interpersonal relationships. Oria considers how generic conventions employed by the show affect discourses on intimacy and how interpersonal relationships at the turn of the century have not only been represented but also fashioned through a relevant popular-culture text.

"Laird of Rogues (The Whisky Lairds, Book 3)",Susan King,ePublishing Works!,2023-05-23,"A Celebrated Smuggler and Whisky Distiller Must Choose Between Love and Freedom in Laird of Rogues, a Scottish Historical Romance from Susan King —Scotland, 1822— When King George IV visits Edinburgh, he expects to meet the distiller of Glenbrae, his favorite whisky. So the city’s deputy lord provost, Sir Hector Graham, acts quickly to release Ronan MacGregor, Laird of Glenbrae—one of the falsely accused Whisky Lairds—from the castle dungeon to tidy him up for the royal occasion. The provost expects his daughter, who speaks Gaelic, to teach the Highlander some English and manners. What the provost doesn’t know: the notorious smuggler is, in fact, a polished lawyer from Perth. Ellison Graham, Sir Hector’s widowed daughter, sets out to transform the rough and rugged Highlander into a gentleman, only to discover he is indeed bred to the peerage, has no intention of meeting the king—and has begun to steal her heart. Sequestered at a Highland estate with Ellison, Ronan continues the ruse while doing his utmost to help his kinsmen and save his whisky business. He never expects to fall in love with the captivating widow—a secret writer of sensational adventure fiction who longs for some passion and adventure of her own. Ronan’s most guarded secret could bring him a viscountcy but ignites a bitter rivalry that threatens his whisky enterprise and soon endangers the woman he loves. Now Ellison must find the courage to face her fears—and Ronan must choose between coveted freedom and protecting the love that could change his life forever...if only he can stay out of the dungeon.

A child was put into a trance, and gave his mesmerist details of the adventures and death of the unhappy Portuguese men and women. With much other detail, the boy described the burial of the great treasure and its exact situation so accurately that the white man and the mesmerist were able to dig for and find the place where it had been -- for the bags were gone, swept out by the floods of the river. In another trance, the boy revealed where the sacks still lay; but before the white trader could renew his search for them, the party was hunted out of the country by natives whose superstitious fears were aroused, barely escaping with their lives. . . .",1980202982,9781980202981,234,N/A,en,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=VHD9tgEACAAJ&dq=romance&hl=&cd=307&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=VHD9tgEACAAJ&dq=romance&hl=&source=gbs_api

Morphological Autonomy,Martin Maiden,"Oxford University Press, USA",2011-08-25,"This book is about the nature of morphology and its place in the structure of grammar. Drawing on a wide range of aspects of Romance inflectional morphology, leading scholars present detailed arguments for the autonomy of morphology, ie morphology has phenomena and mechanisms of its own that are not reducible to syntax or phonology. But which principles and rules govern this independent component and which phenomena can be described or explicated by the mechanisms of the morphemic level? In shedding light on these questions, this volume constitutes a major contribution to Romance historical morphology in particular, and to our understanding of the nature and importance of morphomic structure in language change in general.",0199589984,9780199589982,503,Foreign Language Study,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XE61lsQr4LoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=XE61lsQr4LoC&dq=romance&hl=&cd=310&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=XE61lsQr4LoC&dq=romance&hl=&source=gbs_api
Semi-Sane,Isabel Jordan,Isabel Jordan,2022-02-26,"No one knows crazy quite like Dr. Violet Marchand. As the preeminent psychologist to Whispering Hope’s supernatural population, staying calm, cool, and collected in the face of crazy is sorta part of the gig. So, when she starts receiving death threats, Violet isn’t all that rattled. But when her new bodyguard turns out to be the man who betrayed her—the only man who ever came close to breaching the carefully constructed walls around her heart…well, trusting him again might just be a little too crazy, even for a pro like Violet. Nikolai Aleyev has a lifetime of sins to atone for—not the least of which is betraying Violet’s trust. She’s made it clear she wants nothing more to do with him, and he understands. She’s better off without him. It doesn’t matter that he’s broken and only semi-sane without her. But when he’s assigned to act as Violet’s bodyguard, Nikolai knows he can’t stay away. Protecting her? That’ll be easy for a dhampyre like him. Keeping his hands off her and controlling the attraction that sizzles between them with every touch? That just might be more than he can manage. When bullets—and sparks—start flying, Nikolai will put everything on the line to save Violet—his freedom, his heart, his life. Because sometimes, the line between crazy and happily ever after is razor thin, and the reward just might be worth crossing it. Semi-Sane can be read as a standalone but works best if read as part of the Harper Hall Investigations series. This book is not intended for anyone who doesn’t enjoy smart, kick-ass heroines and the grumpy, protective heroes that love them. Also not intended for anyone who doesn’t appreciate a plethora of nerdy pop culture references and casual cussing. For the rest of you: happy reading!

Discovering Delilah,Melissa Foster,Harborside Nights,2022-07-04,"DISCOVERING DELILAH is lesbian Romance (#LGBT) After the death of her parents on the day of her college graduation, Delilah Armstrong thought she could finally follow her heart and come out to her closest friends, but the guilt of going against her parents' beliefs haunts her. The feelings she has for her best friend, Ashley, are stronger than anything she's felt before, but Delilah has never even kissed a girl, and fear stops her at every turn.Ashley Carver promised herself that she would never again date another girl who wasn't out, but that was before she met intoxicatingly sweet and sexy Delilah.When another girl offers to teach Delilah the ropes, it changes Delilah's whole world and gives her the courage to go after the only girl she really wants. But coming out isn't as easy as Delilah imagined, and moving past her parents' death and the feelings of guilt she is left with is even harder. The intense passion between Ashley and Delilah is too strong to deny, but coming together means risking everything.Discovering Delilah is an edgy, evocative, romantic story of friendship, family, and the courage to love.Ingram",1948004216,9781948004213,0,N/A,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DZc9zwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=DZc9zwEACAAJ&dq=romance&hl=&cd=323&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=DZc9zwEACAAJ&dq=romance&hl=&source=gbs_api

The Subject of Crusade,Marisa Galvez,University of Chicago Press,2020-04-10,"In the Middle Ages, religious crusaders took up arms, prayed, bade farewell to their families, and marched off to fight in holy wars. These Christian soldiers also created accounts of their lives in lyric poetry, putting words to the experience of personal sacrifice and the pious struggle associated with holy war. The crusaders affirmed their commitment to fighting to claim a distant land while revealing their feelings as they left behind their loved ones, homes, and earthly duties. Their poems and related visual works offer us insight into the crusaders’ lives and values at the boundaries of earthly and spiritual duties, body and soul, holy devotion and courtly love. In The Subject of Crusade, Marisa Galvez offers a nuanced view of holy war and crusade poetry, reading these lyric works within a wider conversation with religion and culture. Arguing for an interdisciplinary treatment of crusade lyric, she shows how such poems are crucial for understanding the crusades as a complex cultural and historical phenomenon. Placing them in conversation with chronicles, knightly handbooks, artworks, and confessional and pastoral texts, she identifies a particular “crusade idiom” that emerged out of the conflict between pious and earthly duties. Galvez fashions an expanded understanding of the creative works made by crusaders to reveal their experiences, desires, ideologies, and reasons for taking up the cross.",022669349X,9780226693491,323,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UhTYDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=UhTYDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=romance&hl=&cd=326&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UhTYDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api
