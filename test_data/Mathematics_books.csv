A History of Mathematics,Luke Hodgkin,OUP Oxford,2005-06-02,"A History of Mathematics: From Mesopotamia to Modernity covers the evolution of mathematics through time and across the major Eastern and Western civilizations. It begins in Babylon, then describes the trials and tribulations of the Greek mathematicians. The important, and often neglected, influence of both Chinese and Islamic mathematics is covered in detail, placing the description of early Western mathematics in a global context. The book concludes with modern mathematics, covering recent developments such as the advent of the computer, chaos theory, topology, mathematical physics, and the solution of Fermat's Last Theorem. Containing more than 100 illustrations and figures, this text, aimed at advanced undergraduates and postgraduates, addresses the methods and challenges associated with studying the history of mathematics. The reader is introduced to the leading figures in the history of mathematics (including Archimedes, Ptolemy, Qin Jiushao, al-Kashi, al-Khwarizmi, Galileo, Newton, Leibniz, Helmholtz, Hilbert, Alan Turing, and Andrew Wiles) and their fields.

Foundations and Fundamental Concepts of Mathematics,Howard Whitley Eves,Courier Corporation,1997-01-01,"This third edition of a popular, well-received text offers undergraduates an opportunity to obtain an overview of the historical roots and the evolution of several areas of mathematics. The selection of topics conveys not only their role in this historical development of mathematics but also their value as bases for understanding the changing nature of mathematics. Among the topics covered in this wide-ranging text are: mathematics before Euclid, Euclid's Elements, non-Euclidean geometry, algebraic structure, formal axiomatics, the real numbers system, sets, logic and philosophy and more. The emphasis on axiomatic procedures provides important background for studying and applying more advanced topics, while the inclusion of the historical roots of both algebra and geometry provides essential information for prospective teachers of school mathematics. The readable style and sets of challenging exercises from the popular earlier editions have been continued and extended in the present edition, making this a very welcome and useful version of a classic treatment of the foundations of mathematics.

Mathematics Learning in Early Childhood,"National Research Council, Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education, Center for Education, Committee on Early Childhood Mathematics",National Academies Press,2009-11-13,"Early childhood mathematics is vitally important for young children's present and future educational success. Research demonstrates that virtually all young children have the capability to learn and become competent in mathematics. Furthermore, young children enjoy their early informal experiences with mathematics. Unfortunately, many children's potential in mathematics is not fully realized, especially those children who are economically disadvantaged. This is due, in part, to a lack of opportunities to learn mathematics in early childhood settings or through everyday experiences in the home and in their communities. Improvements in early childhood mathematics education can provide young children with the foundation for school success. Relying on a comprehensive review of the research, Mathematics Learning in Early Childhood lays out the critical areas that should be the focus of young children's early mathematics education, explores the extent to which they are currently being incorporated in early childhood settings, and identifies the changes needed to improve the quality of mathematics experiences for young children. This book serves as a call to action to improve the state of early childhood mathematics. It will be especially useful for policy makers and practitioners-those who work directly with children and their families in shaping the policies that affect the education of young children.",0309147433,9780309147439,399,Education,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=R4Eap3wxpLsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=R4Eap3wxpLsC&pg=PA364&dq=Mathematics&hl=&cd=11&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=R4Eap3wxpLsC&source=gbs_api

"Gender, Science and Mathematics","L. H. Parker, L. Rennie, B. Fraser",Springer Science & Business Media,1995-12-31,"Throughout the Western world, the relationship between gender, science and math ematics has emerged as critical in a variety of contexts. In tertiary institutions, the study of ""gender issues"", frequently with reference to science and mathematics, is of central significance to many disciplines. Gender studies are being offered as sepa rate courses or parts of existing courses in preservice and postgraduate teacher edu cation, women's studies, technology studies and policy studies. In addition, in the broader context of education at all levels from primary/elementary through to higher, concerned policy-makers and practitioners frequently focus on the interaction of gender, science and mathematics in their attempts to reform and improve education for all students. In all of these contexts, there is an urgent need for suitable texts, both to provide resources for teachers and students and to inform policy-makers and practitioners. This book has been developed specifically to meet this need. It is designed to be used throughout the world in a variety of tertiary courses and by policy-makers concerned with activities which interface with the gender/science/mathematics rela tionship. It provides examples which illustrate vividly the rich field from which practitioners and policy-makers in this area now can draw. Its particular appeal will stem from its practical approach and creative future perspective, the international renown of the authors and the generalisability of the recent research and thinking presented in each of the chapters.",0792335821,9780792335825,252,Education,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MYizsfONbUkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=MYizsfONbUkC&pg=PA51&dq=Mathematics&hl=&cd=30&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=MYizsfONbUkC&dq=Mathematics&hl=&source=gbs_api

Perspectives on Mathematics Education,"Bent Christiansen, A.G. Howson, Michael Otte",Springer Science & Business Media,1986,"BACOMET cannot be evaluated solely on the basis of its publications. It is important then that the reader, with only this volume on which to judge both the BACOMET activities and its major outcome to date, should know some thing of what preceded this book's publication. For it is the story of how a group of educators, mainly tutors of student-teachers of mathematics, com mitted themselves to a continuing period of work and self-education. The concept of BACOMET developed during a series of meetings held in 1978-79 between the three editors, Bent Christiansen, Geoffrey Howson and Michael Otte, at which we expressed our concern about the contributions from mathematics education as a discipline to teacher education, both as we observed it and as we participated in it. The short time which was at the teacher-educator's disposal, allied to the limited knowledge and experience of the students on which one had to build, raised puzzling problems concerning priorities and emphases. The recognition that these problems were shared by educators from many different countries was matched by the fact that it would be fruitless to attempt to search for an internationally (or even nationally) acceptable solution to our problems.

A Journey in Mathematics Education Research,"Erna Yackel, Koeno Gravemeijer, Anna Sfard",Springer Science & Business Media,2010-11-30,"Our objective is to publish a book that lays out the theoretical constructs and research methodologies within mathematics education that have been developed by Paul Cobb and explains the process of their development. We propose to do so by including papers in which Cobb introduced new theoretical perspectives and methodologies into the literature, each preceded by a substantive accompanying introductory paper that explains the motivation/rationale for developing the new perspectives and/or methodologies and the processes through which they were developed, and Cobb’s own retrospective comments. In this way the book provides the reader with heretofore unpublished material that lays out in considerable detail the issues and problems that Cobb has confronted in his work, that, from his viewpoint, required theoretical and methodological shifts/advances and provides insight into how he has achieved the shifts/advances. The result will be a volume that, in addition to explaining Cobb’s contributions to the field of mathematics education, also provides the reader with insight into what is involved in developing an aggressive and evolving research program. When Cobb confronts problems and issues in his work that cannot be addressed using his existing theories and frameworks, he looks to other fields for theoretical inspiration. A critical feature of Cobb’s work is that in doing so, he consciously appropriates and adapts ideas from these other fields to the purpose of supporting processes of learning and teaching mathematics; He does not simply accept the goals or motives of those fields. As a result, Cobb reconceptualizes and reframes issues and concepts so that they result in new ways of investigating, exploring, and explaining phenomena that he encounters in the practical dimensions of his work, which include working in classrooms, with teachers, and with school systems. The effect is that the field of mathematics education is altered. Other researchers have found his ""new ways of looking"" useful to them. And they, in turn, adapt these ideas for their own use. The complexity of many of the ideas that Cobb has introduced into the field of mathematics education can lead to a multiplicity of interpretations by practitioners and by other researchers, based on their own experiential backgrounds. Therefore, by detailing the development of Cobb’s work, including the tensions involved in coming to grips with and reconciling apparently contrasting perspectives, the book will shed additional light on the processes of reconceptualization and thus help the reader to understand the reasons, mechanisms, and outcomes of researchers’ constant pursuit of new insights.",9048197295,9789048197293,255,Education,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MktwkNq8XnsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=MktwkNq8XnsC&pg=PA179&dq=Mathematics&hl=&cd=38&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MktwkNq8XnsC&source=gbs_api

Discrete Mathematics Using a Computer,"Cordelia Hall, John O'Donnell",Springer Science & Business Media,2000,"This volume offers a new, hands-on approach to teaching Discrete Mathematics. A simple functional language is used to allow students to experiment with mathematical notations which are traditionally difficult to pick up. This practical approach provides students with instant feedback and also allows lecturers to monitor progress easily. All the material needed to use the book will be available via ftp (the software is freely available and runs on Mac, PC and Unix platforms), including a special module which implements the concepts to be learned.No prior knowledge of Functional Programming is required: apart from List Comprehension (which is comprehensively covered in the text) everything the students need is either provided for them or can be picked up easily as they go along. An Instructors Guide will also be available on the WWW to help lecturers adapt existing courses.",1852330899,9781852330897,362,Computer science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yP4MJ36C4ZgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,3,1,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=yP4MJ36C4ZgC&pg=PA297&dq=Mathematics&hl=&cd=64&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=yP4MJ36C4ZgC&dq=Mathematics&hl=&source=gbs_api

"Foundations of Applied Mathematics, Volume 2","Jeffrey Humpherys, Tyler J. Jarvis",SIAM,2020-03-10,"In this second book of what will be a four-volume series, the authors present, in a mathematically rigorous way, the essential foundations of both the theory and practice of algorithms, approximation, and optimization—essential topics in modern applied and computational mathematics. This material is the introductory framework upon which algorithm analysis, optimization, probability, statistics, machine learning, and control theory are built. This text gives a unified treatment of several topics that do not usually appear together: the theory and analysis of algorithms for mathematicians and data science students; probability and its applications; the theory and applications of approximation, including Fourier series, wavelets, and polynomial approximation; and the theory and practice of optimization, including dynamic optimization. When used in concert with the free supplemental lab materials, Foundations of Applied Mathematics, Volume 2: Algorithms, Approximation, Optimization teaches not only the theory but also the computational practice of modern mathematical methods. Exercises and examples build upon each other in a way that continually reinforces previous ideas, allowing students to retain learned concepts while achieving a greater depth.

Elements of Mathematics,Gabor Toth,Springer Nature,2021-09-23,"This textbook offers a rigorous presentation of mathematics before the advent of calculus. Fundamental concepts in algebra, geometry, and number theory are developed from the foundations of set theory along an elementary, inquiry-driven path. Thought-provoking examples and challenging problems inspired by mathematical contests motivate the theory, while frequent historical asides reveal the story of how the ideas were originally developed. Beginning with a thorough treatment of the natural numbers via Peano’s axioms, the opening chapters focus on establishing the natural, integral, rational, and real number systems. Plane geometry is introduced via Birkhoff’s axioms of metric geometry, and chapters on polynomials traverse arithmetical operations, roots, and factoring multivariate expressions. An elementary classification of conics is given, followed by an in-depth study of rational expressions. Exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric functions complete the picture, driven by inequalities that compare them with polynomial and rational functions. Axioms and limits underpin the treatment throughout, offering not only powerful tools, but insights into non-trivial connections between topics. Elements of Mathematics is ideal for students seeking a deep and engaging mathematical challenge based on elementary tools. Whether enhancing the early undergraduate curriculum for high achievers, or constructing a reflective senior capstone, instructors will find ample material for enquiring mathematics majors. No formal prerequisites are assumed beyond high school algebra, making the book ideal for mathematics circles and competition preparation. Readers who are more advanced in their mathematical studies will appreciate the interleaving of ideas and illuminating historical details.",3030750515,9783030750510,534,Mathematics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bJhEEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=bJhEEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mathematics&hl=&cd=163&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bJhEEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Worked Examples in Mathematics for Scientists and Engineers,G. Stephenson,Courier Dover Publications,2019-10-16,"This rich collection of fully worked problems in many areas of mathematics covers all the important subjects students are likely to encounter in their courses, from introductory to final-year undergraduate classes. Because lecture courses tend to focus on theory rather than examples, these exercises offer a valuable complement to classroom teachings, promoting the understanding of mathematical techniques and helping students prepare for exams. They will prove useful to undergraduates in mathematics; students in engineering, physics, and chemistry; and postgraduate scientists looking for a way to refresh their skills in specific topics. The problems can supplement lecture notes and any conventional text.

Number Theory,W.A. Coppel,Springer,2006-02-02,"Undergraduate courses in mathematics are commonly of two types. On the one hand are courses in subjects - such as linear algebra or real analysis - with which it is considered that every student of mathematics should be acquainted. On the other hand are courses given by lecturers in their own areas of specialization, which are intended to serve as a preparation for research. But after taking courses of only these two types, students might not perceive the sometimes surprising interrelationships and analogies between different branches of mathematics, and students who do not go on to become professional mathematicians might never gain a clear understanding of the nature and extent of mathematics. The two-volume Number Theory: An Introduction to Mathematics attempts to provide such an understanding of the nature and extent of mathematics. It is a modern introduction to the theory of numbers, emphasizing its connections with other branches of mathematics. Part A, which should be accessible to a first-year undergraduate, deals with elementary number theory. Part B is more advanced than the first and should give the reader some idea of the scope of mathematics today. The connecting theme is the theory of numbers. By exploring its many connections with other branches, we may obtain a broad picture.",0387300198,9780387300191,734,Mathematics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BJSOtAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=BJSOtAEACAAJ&dq=Mathematics&hl=&cd=188&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=BJSOtAEACAAJ&dq=Mathematics&hl=&source=gbs_api

Should we think physically and then add the mathematics apt to formalise our physical intuition, or should we think mathematically and then interpret physically the obtained results? Do we get mathematical objects by abstraction from real objects, or vice versa? Why is mathematics effective into physics? These are all relevant questions, whose answers are necessary to fully understand the status of physics, particularly of contemporary physics.

Mathematics For Computation (M4c),"Marco Benini, Olaf Beyersdorff, Michael Rathjen, Peter Michael Schuster",World Scientific,2023-03-21,"The overall topic of the volume, Mathematics for Computation (M4C), is mathematics taking crucially into account the aspect of computation, investigating the interaction of mathematics with computation, bridging the gap between mathematics and computation wherever desirable and possible, and otherwise explaining why not.Recently, abstract mathematics has proved to have more computational content than ever expected. Indeed, the axiomatic method, originally intended to do away with concrete computations, seems to suit surprisingly well the programs-from-proofs paradigm, with abstraction helping not only clarity but also efficiency.Unlike computational mathematics, which rather focusses on objects of computational nature such as algorithms, the scope of M4C generally encompasses all the mathematics, including abstract concepts such as functions. The purpose of M4C actually is a strongly theory-based and therefore, is a more reliable and sustainable approach to actual computation, up to the systematic development of verified software.While M4C is situated within mathematical logic and the related area of theoretical computer science, in principle it involves all branches of mathematics, especially those which prompt computational considerations. In traditional terms, the topics of M4C include proof theory, constructive mathematics, complexity theory, reverse mathematics, type theory, category theory and domain theory.The aim of this volume is to provide a point of reference by presenting up-to-date contributions by some of the most active scholars in each field.

The failure of such efforts has raised questions suggesting that what was missing at the outset of these proposals, designs, and productions was a more profound knowledge of the phenomena of learning and teaching mathematics in socially established and culturally, politically, and economically justified institutions - namely, schools. Such knowledge cannot be built by mere juxtaposition of theories in disci plines such as psychology, sociology, and mathematics. Psychological theories focus on the individual learner. Theories of sociology of education look at the general laws of curriculum development, the specifics of pedagogic discourse as opposed to scientific discourse in general, the different possible pedagogic rela tions between the teacher and the taught, and other general problems in the inter face between education and society. Mathematics, aside from its theoretical contents, can be looked at from historical and epistemological points of view, clarifying the genetic development of its concepts, methods, and theories. This view can shed some light on the meaning of mathematical concepts and on the difficulties students have in teaching approaches that disregard the genetic development of these concepts.",9401151946,9789401151948,244,Education,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xKWZBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=xKWZBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mathematics&hl=&cd=200&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xKWZBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

The Concept of Stability in Numerical Mathematics,Wolfgang Hackbusch,Springer Science & Business Media,2014-02-06,"In this book, the author compares the meaning of stability in different subfields of numerical mathematics. Concept of Stability in numerical mathematics opens by examining the stability of finite algorithms. A more precise definition of stability holds for quadrature and interpolation methods, which the following chapters focus on. The discussion then progresses to the numerical treatment of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). While one-step methods for ODEs are always stable, this is not the case for hyperbolic or parabolic differential equations, which are investigated next. The final chapters discuss stability for discretisations of elliptic differential equations and integral equations. In comparison among the subfields we discuss the practical importance of stability and the possible conflict between higher consistency order and stability.",3642393861,9783642393860,202,Mathematics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mq-9BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=mq-9BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mathematics&hl=&cd=205&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mq-9BAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

The Meaning of Proofs,Gabriele Lolli,National Geographic Books,2022-09-27,"Why mathematics is not merely formulaic: an argument that to write a mathematical proof is tantamount to inventing a story. In The Meaning of Proofs, mathematician Gabriele Lolli argues that to write a mathematical proof is tantamount to inventing a story. Lolli offers not instructions for how to write mathematical proofs, but a philosophical and poetic reflection on mathematical proofs as narrative. Mathematics, imprisoned within its symbols and images, Lolli writes, says nothing if its meaning is not narrated in a story. The minute mathematicians open their mouths to explain something—the meaning of x, how to find y—they are framing a narrative. Every proof is the story of an adventure, writes Lolli, a journey into an unknown land to open a new, connected route; once the road is open, we correct it, expand it. Just as fairy tales offer a narrative structure in which new characters can be inserted into recurring forms of the genre in original ways, in mathematics, each new abstract concept is the protagonist of a different theory supported by the general techniques of mathematical reasoning. In ancient Greece, there was more than an analogy between literature and mathematics, there was direct influence. Euclid’s proofs have roots in poetry and rhetoric. Mathematics, Lolli asserts, is not the mere manipulation of formulas.",0262544261,9780262544269,0,Mathematics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=buCMEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=buCMEAAAQBAJ&dq=Mathematics&hl=&cd=207&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=buCMEAAAQBAJ&dq=Mathematics&hl=&source=gbs_api

A Contemporary Theory of Mathematics Education Research,Tony Brown,Springer,2020-12-12,"This book by-passes both psychology and sociology to present an original social theory centered on seeing mathematical learning by everyone as an intrinsic dimension of how mathematics develops as a field in support of human activity. Here, mathematics is defined by how we collectively talk about it. Drawing on psychoanalytic theory, the student is seen as participating in the renewal of mathematics through their contributions to our collective gaze on mathematics as the field responds to ever new demands. As such learning takes a critical stance on the standard initiations into current practices often promoted by formal education. In the field of mathematics education, researchers have moved from psychology where individual students were seen as following natural paths of development through existing mathematical knowledge, to socio-cultural models predicated on students being initiated into the human world and understood through the reflective gazes this world has of itself, such as those found in comparisons of student learning in different countries. This book addresses the domain, purpose and functioning of contemporary research in mathematics education and is an original contribution to this theme. The book is aimed at a mathematics education research audience. It continues a dialogue with existing publications, seen widely as a cutting edge and will also be of interest to students and practitioners in the fields of qualitative research, social theory and psychology.",3030550990,9783030550998,151,Education,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=goaXzQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=goaXzQEACAAJ&dq=Mathematics&hl=&cd=210&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=goaXzQEACAAJ&dq=Mathematics&hl=&source=gbs_api

Young Children as Mathematicians,Dianna Mannigel,N/A,1992,"This text is for students in early childhood teacher education courses. It focuses on mathematics education with children from three to eight years, in preschool and the early primary grades. It could also be used by teachers wishing to become familiar with maths in these early childhood years. The integration of theory and practice occurs through topics about how children learn, what they learn as young mathematicians, the provision of an appropriate learning environment, and relevant teaching strategies. The text provides a developmental basis for new approaches to mathematics education, and explains how teachers can organise the learning environment so children can construct their own knowledge. It steers a middle course between closed, over-structured teaching and laissez- faire, unsupported experience. Detailed lists of developmental sequences help teachers to identify children's mathematical thinking so they can offer appropriate support at the right time. It offers guidance in the use of curriculum documents from state education departments, for developing a mathematics program. In view of increasing use of games in maths education, a chapter offers not only games, but general principles about the use, purchase and adaptation of games. Each chapter includes activities for students.",N/A,N/A,256,Mathematics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XxcJAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=XxcJAQAAMAAJ&q=Mathematics&dq=Mathematics&hl=&cd=227&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=XxcJAQAAMAAJ&dq=Mathematics&hl=&source=gbs_api
Effective Mathematics Teaching from Teachers' Perspectives,N/A,BRILL,2009-01-01,"What is effective mathematics teaching? This book represents the first purposeful cross-cultural collection of studies to answer this question from teachers’ perspectives. It focuses particularly on how teachers view effective teaching of mathematics. Teachers’ voices are heard and celebrated throughout the studies reported in this volume. These studies are drawn from many parts of the world representing both Eastern and Western cultural traditions. The editors and authors have deliberately included the views of teachers and educators from different cultural backgrounds, taking into account that beliefs on effective mathematics teaching and its features are highly influenced by one’s own culture.

Essential Mathematics for Applied Fields,R.M. Meyer,Springer,1979-10-31,"1. Purpose The purpose of this work is to provide, in one volume, a wide spectrum of essential (non-measure theoretic) Mathematics for use by workers in the variety of applied fields. To obtain the background developed here in one volume would require studying a prohibitive number of separate Mathematics courses (assuming they were available). Before, much of the material now covered was (a) unavailable, (b) too widely scattered, or (c) too advanced as presented, to be of use to those who need it. Here, we present a sound basis requiring only Calculus through however, Differential Equations. It provides the needed flexibility to cope, in a rigorous manner, with the every-day, non-standard and new situations that present themselves. There is no substitute for this. 2. Arrangement The volume consists of twenty Sections, falling into several natural units: Basic Real Analysis 1. Sets, Sequences, Series, and Functions 2. Doubly Infinite Sequences and Series 3. Sequences and Series of Functions 4. Real Power Series 5. Behavior of a Function Near a Point: Various Types of Limits 6. Orders of Magnitude: the D, 0, ~ Notation 7.

Mathematics in Engineering and Science,"L. R. Mustoe, M. D. J. Barry",John Wiley & Sons,1998-06-11,"mathematics in Engineering and Science L. R. Mustoe Loughborough University, UK M. D. J. Barry University of Bristol, UK In today's world, technology plays an increasingly important role. At the same time, mathematics is finding ever wider areas of application as we seek to understand more about the way in which nature works. Traditionally, engineering and science have relied on mathematical models for design and for the prediction of the behaviour of phenomena. Although widespread availability of computers and pocket calculators has reduced the need for long, tedious calculations to be carried out manually, it is still important to be able to perform simple calculations in order to have a feel for the processes involved. This book starts with a detailed synopsis of the material included in the authors' related textbook Foundation Mathematics (Wiley, 1998). It then expands the material in the areas of trigonometry, solution of equations and algebra. Vectors are covered next, then calculus is taken forward into geometrical applications. Matrix algebra and uncertainty follow before deeper analysis in chapters on integer variables, differential equations and complex numbers leads towards an appendix on mathematical modelling. Each chapter opens with a list of learning objectives and ends with a summary of key points and results. A generous supply of worked examples incorporating motivational applications is designed to build knowledge and skill. Drill and practice is essential and the exercises are graded in difficulty for reading and revision: the answers at the end of each chapter include helpful hints. Use of a pocket calculator is encouraged where appropriate. Many of the exercises can be validated by computer algebra and its use is strongly recommended where higher algebraic accuracy can be achieved and drudgery removed. The concise and focused approach of Mathematics in Engineering and Science will enable the student reader to approach the challenges of mathematics in a course at university level with confidence.

Mathematics and Climate,"Hans Kaper, Hans Engler",SIAM,2013-10-18,"Mathematics and Climate is a timely textbook aimed at students and researchers in mathematics and statistics who are interested in current issues of climate science, as well as at climate scientists who wish to become familiar with qualitative and quantitative methods of mathematics and statistics. The authors emphasize conceptual models that capture important aspects of Earth's climate system and present the mathematical and statistical techniques that can be applied to their analysis. Topics from climate science include the Earth?s energy balance, temperature distribution, ocean circulation patterns such as El Ni?o?Southern Oscillation, ice caps and glaciation periods, the carbon cycle, and the biological pump. Among the mathematical and statistical techniques presented in the text are dynamical systems and bifurcation theory, Fourier analysis, conservation laws, regression analysis, and extreme value theory. The following features make Mathematics and Climate a valuable teaching resource: issues of current interest in climate science and sustainability are used to introduce the student to the methods of mathematics and statistics; the mathematical sophistication increases as the book progresses and topics can thus be selected according to interest and level of knowledge; each chapter ends with a set of exercises that reinforce or enhance the material presented in the chapter and stimulate critical thinking and communication skills; and the book contains an extensive list of references to the literature, a glossary of terms for the nontechnical reader, and a detailed index.",1611972604,9781611972603,303,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UW6BAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=UW6BAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mathematics&hl=&cd=241&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=UW6BAQAAQBAJ&dq=Mathematics&hl=&source=gbs_api

This is especially true of one equation: ei(pi) + 1 = 0, the brainchild of Leonhard Euler, the Mozart of mathematics. More than two centuries after Euler's death, it is still regarded as a conceptual diamond of unsurpassed beauty. Called Euler's identity or God's equation, it includes just five numbers but represents an astonishing revelation of hidden connections. It ties together everything from basic arithmetic to compound interest, the circumference of a circle, trigonometry, calculus, and even infinity. In David Stipp's hands, Euler's identity formula becomes a contemplative stroll through the glories of mathematics.

Radical Constructivism in Mathematics Education,E. Glasersfeld,Springer Science & Business Media,2006-04-11,"Mathematics is the science of acts without things - and through this, of things one can define by acts. 1 Paul Valéry The essays collected in this volume form a mosaik of theory, research, and practice directed at the task of spreading mathematical knowledge. They address questions raised by the recurrent observation that, all too frequently, the present ways and means of teaching mathematics generate in the student a lasting aversion against numbers, rather than an understanding of the useful and sometimes enchanting things one can do with them. Parents, teachers, and researchers in the field of education are well aware of this dismal situation, but their views about what causes the wide-spread failure and what steps should be taken to correct it have so far not come anywhere near a practicable consensus. The authors of the chapters in this book have all had extensive experience in teaching as well as in educational research. They approach the problems they have isolated from their own individual perspectives. Yet, they share both an overall goal and a specific fundamental conviction that characterized the efforts about which they write here. The common goal is to find a better way to teach mathematics. The common conviction is that knowledge cannot simply be transferred ready-made from parent to child or from teacher to student but has to be actively built up by each learner in his or her own mind.",0306472015,9780306472015,264,Education,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PmgQBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=PmgQBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mathematics&hl=&cd=244&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PmgQBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api
The Nature and Power of Mathematics,Donald M. Davis,Dover Publications,2004-12-23,"This captivating book explains some of mathematics' most fascinating ideas to nonspecialists. It explores items of philosophical and historical interest, discusses the often-surprising applicability of mathematics, and reveals the subject's intrinsic beauty. Author Donald M. Davis focuses on three main areas: non-Euclidean geometry, a basis for relativity theory; number theory, a major component of cryptography; and fractals, the key elements of computer-generated art. He also discusses related topics, such as the relevance of Greek mathematics to Kepler's laws of planetary motion, and the theoretical work that led to the development of computers. Only a background in basic algebra and geometry is necessary to appreciate this volume, which features exercises that further develop some of its important concepts. Graded according to difficulty, these exercises are designed to improve readers' skills in logic, and to enable them to experience mathematics at increasingly advanced levels.

"Essential Mathematics for the Physical Sciences, Volume 1","Brett Borden, James Luscombe",Morgan & Claypool Publishers,2017-10-31,"Physics is expressed in the language of mathematics; it is deeply ingrained in how physics is taught and how it's practiced. A study of the mathematics used in science is thus asound intellectual investment for training as scientists and engineers. This first volume of two is centered on methods of solving partial differential equations (PDEs) and the special functions introduced. Solving PDEs can't be done, however, outside of the context in which they apply to physical systems. The solutions to PDEs must conform to boundary conditions, a set of additional constraints in space or time to be satisfied at the boundaries of the system, that small part of the universe under study. The first volume is devoted to homogeneous boundary-value problems (BVPs), homogeneous implying a system lacking a forcing function, or source function. The second volume takes up (in addition to other topics) inhomogeneous problems where, in addition to the intrinsic PDE governing a physical field, source functions are an essential part of the system. This text is based on a course offered at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) and while produced for NPS needs, it will serve other universities well. It is based on the assumption that it follows a math review course, and was designed to coincide with the second quarter of student study, which is dominated by BVPs but also requires an understanding of special functions and Fourier analysis.",1681744856,9781681744858,192,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nD9iDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=nD9iDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mathematics&hl=&cd=246&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=nD9iDwAAQBAJ&dq=Mathematics&hl=&source=gbs_api

Connecting Mathematics and Mathematics Education,Erich Christian Wittmann,Springer,2021-01-09,"This Open Access book features a selection of articles written by Erich Ch. Wittmann between 1984 to 2019, which shows how the “design science conception” has been continuously developed over a number of decades. The articles not only describe this conception in general terms, but also demonstrate various substantial learning environments that serve as typical examples. In terms of teacher education, the book provides clear information on how to combine (well-understood) mathematics and methods courses to benefit of teachers. The role of mathematics in mathematics education is often explicitly and implicitly reduced to the delivery of subject matter that then has to be selected and made palpable for students using methods imported from psychology, sociology, educational research and related disciplines. While these fields have made significant contributions to mathematics education in recent decades, it cannot be ignored that mathematics itself, if well understood, provides essential knowledge for teaching mathematics beyond the pure delivery of subject matter. For this purpose, mathematics has to be conceived of as an organism that is deeply rooted in elementary operations of the human mind, which can be seamlessly developed to higher and higher levels so that the full richness of problems of various degrees of difficulty, and different means of representation, problem-solving strategies, and forms of proof can be used in ways that are appropriate for the respective level. This view of mathematics is essential for designing learning environments and curricula, for conducting empirical studies on truly mathematical processes and also for implementing the findings of mathematics education in teacher education, where it is crucial to take systemic constraints into account.",3030615693,9783030615697,318,Education,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1lbazQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=1lbazQEACAAJ&dq=Mathematics&hl=&cd=254&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=1lbazQEACAAJ&dq=Mathematics&hl=&source=gbs_api

And working for fundamental social change and rectifying injustice are rarely included in any mathematics curriculum. Reading and Writing the World withMathematics argues that mathematics education should prepare students to investigate and critique injustice, and to challenge, in words and actions, oppressive structures and acts. Based on teacher-research, the book provides a theoretical framework and practical examples for how mathematics educators can connect schooling to a larger sociopolitical context and concretely teach mathematics for social justice.",1136284656,9781136284656,274,Education,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vHJXabvLhhAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=vHJXabvLhhAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mathematics&hl=&cd=255&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=vHJXabvLhhAC&dq=Mathematics&hl=&source=gbs_api
Introduction to the Foundations of Applied Mathematics,Mark H. Holmes,Springer,2019-10-15,"The objective of this textbook is the construction, analysis, and interpretation of mathematical models to help us understand the world we live in. Rather than follow a case study approach it develops the mathematical and physical ideas that are fundamental in understanding contemporary problems in science and engineering. Science evolves, and this means that the problems of current interest continually change. What does not change as quickly is the approach used to derive the relevant mathematical models, and the methods used to analyze the models. Consequently, this book is written in such a way as to establish the mathematical ideas underlying model development independently of a specific application. This does not mean applications are not considered, they are, and connections with experiment are a staple of this book. The book, as well as the individual chapters, is written in such a way that the material becomes more sophisticated as you progress. This provides some flexibility in how the book is used, allowing consideration for the breadth and depth of the material covered. Moreover, there are a wide spectrum of exercises and detailed illustrations that significantly enrich the material. Students and researchers interested in mathematical modelling in mathematics, physics, engineering and the applied sciences will find this text useful. The material, and topics, have been updated to include recent developments in mathematical modeling. The exercises have also been expanded to include these changes, as well as enhance those from the first edition. Review of first edition: ""The goal of this book is to introduce the mathematical tools needed for analyzing and deriving mathematical models. ... Holmes is able to integrate the theory with application in a very nice way providing an excellent book on applied mathematics. ... One of the best features of the book is the abundant number of exercises found at the end of each chapter. ... I think this is a great book, and I recommend it for scholarly purposes by students, teachers, and researchers.""

It is a translation with updates and editorial comments of the Soviet Mathematical Encyclopaedia published by 'Soviet Encyclopaedia Publishing House' in five volumes in 1977-1985. The annotated translation consists of ten volumes including a special index volume. There are three kinds of articles in this ENCYCLOPAEDIA. First of all there are survey-type articles dealing with the various main directions in mathematics (where a rather fine subdivi sion has been used). The main requirement for these articles has been that they should give a reasonably complete up-to-date account of the current state of affairs in these areas and that they should be maximally accessible. On the whole, these articles should be understandable to mathematics students in their first specialization years, to graduates from other mathematical areas and, depending on the specific subject, to specialists in other domains of science, en gineers and teachers of mathematics. These articles treat their material at a fairly general level and aim to give an idea of the kind of problems, techniques and concepts involved in the area in question.

The motivation for these volumes is to foster interaction between Industry and Mathematics at the ""grass roots""; that is, at the level of spe cific problems. These problems come from Industry: they arise from models developed by the industrial scientists in ventures directed at the manufac ture of new or improved products. At the same time, these problems have the potential for mathematical challenge and novelty. To identify such problems, I have visited industries and had discussions with their scientists. Some of the scientists have subsequently presented their problems in the IMA seminar on Industrial Problems. The book is based on questions raised in the seminar and subsequent discussions. Each chapter is devoted to one of the talks and is self-contained. The chap ters usually provide references to the mathematical literature and a list of open problems which are of interest to the industrial scientists.

Advanced Engineering Mathematics,"Merle C. Potter, Jack L. Lessing, Edward F. Aboufadel",N/A,2019,"This book is designed to serve as a core text for courses in advanced engineering mathematics required by many engineering departments. The style of presentation is such that the student, with a minimum of assistance, can follow the step-by-step derivations. Liberal use of examples and homework probƯlems aid the student in the study of the topics presented. Ordinary differential equations, including a number of physical applicaƯtions, are reviewed in Chapter One. The use of series methods are presented in Chapter Two, Subsequent chapters present Laplace transforms, matrix theory and applications, vector analysis, Fourier series and transforms, partial differential equations, numerical methods using finite differences, complex variƯables, and wavelets. The material is presented so that four or five subjects can be covered in a single course, depending on the topics chosen and the completeness of coverage. Incorporated in this textbook is the use of certain computer software packages. Short tutorials on Maple, demonstrating how problems in engineering mathematics can be solved with a computer algebra system, are included in most sections of the text. Problems have been identified at the end of sections to be solved specifically with Maple, and there are computer laboratory activities, which are more difficult problems designed for Maple. In addition, MATLAB and Excel have been included in the solution of problems in several of the chapters. There is a solutions manual available for those who select the text for their course. This text can be used in two semesters of engineering mathematics.

Driven by increasingly elaborate modern technological applications the symbiotic relationship between mathematics and mechanics is continually growing. However, the increasingly large number of specialist journals has generated a du ality gap between the two partners, and this gap is growing wider. Advances in Mechanics and Mathematics (AMMA) is intended to bridge the gap by providing multi-disciplinary publications which fall into the two following complementary categories: 1. An annual book dedicated to the latest developments in mechanics and mathematics; 2. Monographs, advanced textbooks, handbooks, edited vol umes and selected conference proceedings. The AMMA annual book publishes invited and contributed compre hensive reviews, research and survey articles within the broad area of modern mechanics and applied mathematics.

Focus on Mathematics Education Research,Keith Patterson,Nova Science Publishers,2017,"Lecturing quality and professional development for lecturers has received growing attention within international undergraduate mathematics forums. The use of videos to inform teacher-practice has been common in research and in pre-service teacher education for many years. However, more recent interest has focused on how videos may be used for professional development of teachers, as separate from the more common research focus. It is indisputable that the verification of the gained knowledge constitutes a significant part of educational process. It not only provides the pupils and their parents with important information on the level of gained capabilities, but it is also a form of control for a teacher who can on the basis of them assess the efficiency of the methods used in the teaching process. Early mathematics education is foundational and attention to quality early math education is vital to ensure students succeed in schools. This book also looks at an innovative approach designed for mathematics in chemistry degree courses, which takes advantage of the Laplace Transform versatility. Strong content knowledge not only allows mathematics teachers to recognize students misconceptions, but it also enables them to direct students to a deeper understanding of the concepts involved. There is empirical evidence to indicate that mathematics teachers who possess deep content knowledge in the subject area tend to have greater repertoire of effective instructional strategies. Since the late eighties, research on the history of mathematics education in Spain has experienced an increase.

Clifford Algebra to Geometric Calculus,"D. Hestenes, Garret Sobczyk",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Matrix algebra has been called ""the arithmetic of higher mathematics"" [Be]. We think the basis for a better arithmetic has long been available, but its versatility has hardly been appreciated, and it has not yet been integrated into the mainstream of mathematics. We refer to the system commonly called 'Clifford Algebra', though we prefer the name 'Geometric Algebm' suggested by Clifford himself. Many distinct algebraic systems have been adapted or developed to express geometric relations and describe geometric structures. Especially notable are those algebras which have been used for this purpose in physics, in particular, the system of complex numbers, the quatemions, matrix algebra, vector, tensor and spinor algebras and the algebra of differential forms. Each of these geometric algebras has some significant advantage over the others in certain applications, so no one of them provides an adequate algebraic structure for all purposes of geometry and physics.

These authors suggest that by encouraging children to represent mathematical ideas in their own ways and, crucially, by talking to the pupils about the marks they have made, we are given a ""window"" onto their thinking that may otherwise be inaccessible′ - Liz Pumphrey, NRICH This book draws on the authors′ many years of teaching children aged three to eight years and also on their extensive research with children in the home, nursery and school. The authors explain the development and range of young children′s mathematical marks and visual representations, showing how children make mental connections between their own early marks and subsequent abstract mathematical symbolism, and go on to develop their own written methods. Combining theory and practice, this acclaimed book demonstrates how children′s own mathematical graphics are highly creative and show deep levels of thinking. The authors show how this is the key to success in school mathematics and to higher levels of achievement.

Opening the Cage,"Ole Skovsmose, Brian Greer",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-09-05,"The picture on the front of this book is an illustration for Totakahini: The tale of the parrot, by Rabindranath Tagore, in which he satirized education as a magnificent golden cage. Opening the cage addresses mathematics education as a complex socio-political phenomenon, exploring the vast terrain that spans critique and politics. Opening the cage includes contributions from educators writing critically about mathematics education in diverse contexts. They demonstrate that mathematics education is politics, they investigate borderland positions, they address the nexus of mathematics, education, and power, and they explore educational possibilities. Mathematics education is not a free enterprise. It is carried on behind bars created by economic, political, and social demands. This cage might not be as magnificent as that in Tagore’s fable.

Mathematics without Apologies,Michael Harris,Princeton University Press,2017-05-30,"An insightful reflection on the mathematical soul What do pure mathematicians do, and why do they do it? Looking beyond the conventional answers—for the sake of truth, beauty, and practical applications—this book offers an eclectic panorama of the lives and values and hopes and fears of mathematicians in the twenty-first century, assembling material from a startlingly diverse assortment of scholarly, journalistic, and pop culture sources. Drawing on his personal experiences and obsessions as well as the thoughts and opinions of mathematicians from Archimedes and Omar Khayyám to such contemporary giants as Alexander Grothendieck and Robert Langlands, Michael Harris reveals the charisma and romance of mathematics as well as its darker side. In this portrait of mathematics as a community united around a set of common intellectual, ethical, and existential challenges, he touches on a wide variety of questions, such as: Are mathematicians to blame for the 2008 financial crisis? How can we talk about the ideas we were born too soon to understand? And how should you react if you are asked to explain number theory at a dinner party? Disarmingly candid, relentlessly intelligent, and richly entertaining, Mathematics without Apologies takes readers on an unapologetic guided tour of the mathematical life, from the philosophy and sociology of mathematics to its reflections in film and popular music, with detours through the mathematical and mystical traditions of Russia, India, medieval Islam, the Bronx, and beyond.",1400885523,9781400885527,467,Mathematics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zfmhDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=zfmhDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mathematics&hl=&cd=309&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zfmhDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

"Mathematics That Power Our World, The: How Is It Made?","Joseph Khoury, Gilles Lamothe",World Scientific,2016-05-12,"The Mathematics That Power Our World: How Is It Made? is an attempt to unveil the hidden mathematics behind the functioning of many of the devices we use on a daily basis. For the past years, discussions on the best approach in teaching and learning mathematics have shown how much the world is divided on this issue. The one reality we seem to agree on globally is the fact that our new generation is lacking interest and passion for the subject. One has the impression that the vast majority of young students finishing high school or in their early post-secondary studies are more and more divided into two main groups when it comes to the perception of mathematics. The first group looks at mathematics as a pure academic subject with little connection to the real world. The second group considers mathematics as a set of tools that a computer can be programmed to use and thus, a basic knowledge of the subject is sufficient. This book serves as a middle ground between these two views. Many of the elegant and seemingly theoretical concepts of mathematics are linked to state-of-the-art technologies. The topics of the book are selected carefully to make that link more relevant. They include: digital calculators, basics of data compression and the Huffman coding, the JPEG standard for data compression, the GPS system studied both from the receiver and the satellite ends, image processing and face recognition.This book is a great resource for mathematics educators in high schools, colleges and universities who want to engage their students in advanced readings that go beyond the classroom discussions. It is also a solid foundation for anyone thinking of pursuing a career in science or engineering. All efforts were made so that the exposition of each topic is as clear and self-contained as possible and thus, appealing to anyone trying to broaden his mathematical horizons.",9814730866,9789814730860,202,Mathematics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=T162DAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=T162DAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mathematics&hl=&cd=328&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=T162DAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

This thoroughly revised second edition of Mathematica Beyond Mathematics: The Wolfram Language in the Real World introduces the new features using real-world examples based on the experience of the author as a consultant and Wolfram certified instructor. The examples strike a balance between relevance and difficulty in terms of Mathematica syntax, allowing readers to incrementally build up their Mathematica skills as they go through the chapters While reading this book, you will also learn more about the Wolfram Language and how to use it to solve a wide variety of problems. The author raises questions from a wide range of topics and answers them by taking full advantage of Mathematica's latest features. For example: What sources of energy does the world really use? Are our cities getting warmer? Is the novel El Quixote written in Pi? Is it possible to reliably date the Earth using radioactive isotopes? How can we find planets outside our solar system? How can we model epidemics, earthquakes and other natural phenomena? What is the best way to compare organisms genetically?

Introduction to the Economics and Mathematics of Financial Markets,"Jaksa Cvitanic, Fernando Zapatero",National Geographic Books,2004-02-27,"An innovative textbook for use in advanced undergraduate and graduate courses; accessible to students in financial mathematics, financial engineering and economics. Introduction to the Economics and Mathematics of Financial Markets fills the longstanding need for an accessible yet serious textbook treatment of financial economics. The book provides a rigorous overview of the subject, while its flexible presentation makes it suitable for use with different levels of undergraduate and graduate students. Each chapter presents mathematical models of financial problems at three different degrees of sophistication: single-period, multi-period, and continuous-time. The single-period and multi-period models require only basic calculus and an introductory probability/statistics course, while an advanced undergraduate course in probability is helpful in understanding the continuous-time models. In this way, the material is given complete coverage at different levels; the less advanced student can stop before the more sophisticated mathematics and still be able to grasp the general principles of financial economics. The book is divided into three parts.

Art Meets Mathematics in the Fourth Dimension,Stephen Leon Lipscomb,Springer,2014-10-13,"To see objects that live in the fourth dimension we humans would need to add a fourth dimension to our three-dimensional vision. An example of such an object that lives in the fourth dimension is a hyper-sphere or “3-sphere.” The quest to imagine the elusive 3-sphere has deep historical roots: medieval poet Dante Alighieri used a 3-sphere to convey his allegorical vision of the Christian afterlife in his Divine Comedy. In 1917, Albert Einstein visualized the universe as a 3-sphere, describing this imagery as “the place where the reader’s imagination boggles. Nobody can imagine this thing.” Over time, however, understanding of the concept of a dimension evolved. By 2003, a researcher had successfully rendered into human vision the structure of a 4-web (think of an ever increasingly-dense spider’s web). In this text, Stephen Lipscomb takes his innovative dimension theory research a step further, using the 4-web to reveal a new partial image of a 3-sphere. Illustrations support the reader’s understanding of the mathematics behind this process. Lipscomb describes a computer program that can produce partial images of a 3-sphere and suggests methods of discerning other fourth-dimensional objects that may serve as the basis for future artwork.",3319062549,9783319062549,191,Mathematics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qkrPBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=qkrPBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mathematics&hl=&cd=355&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qkrPBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Transreform Radical Humanism,Gale Russell,Springer,2017-08-24,"In Transreform Radical Humanism: A Mathematics and Teaching Philosophy, a methodological collage of auto/ethnography, Gadamerian hermeneutics, and grounded theory is used to analyze a diverse collection of data: the author’s evolving relationship with mathematics; the philosophies of mathematics; the “math wars”; the achievement gap for Indigenous students in mathematics and some of the lessons learned from ethnomathematics; and risk education as an emerging topic within mathematics curricula. Foundational to this analysis is a new theoretical framework that envelops an Indigenous worldview and the Traditional Western worldview, acting as a pair of voices (and lenses) that speak to the points of tension, conflict, and possibility found throughout the data. This analysis of the data sets results in the emergence of a new theory, the Transreform Approach to the teaching and learning of mathematics, and in the transreform radical humanistic philosophy of mathematics. Within these pages, mathematics, the teaching and learning of mathematics, hegemony, and the valuing of different kinds of knowledge and ways of knowing collide, sometimes merge, and most frequently become transformed in ways that hold promise for students, teachers, society, and even mathematics itself. As the assumed incommensurability of worldviews is challenged, so too new possibilities emerge. It is hoped that readers will not just read this work, but engage with it, exploring the kinds of knowledge and ways of knowing that they value within mathematics and the teaching and learning of mathematics and why.",9463510745,9789463510745,248,Education,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bXsyDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=bXsyDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mathematics&hl=&cd=360&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bXsyDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Mathematics in Industrial Problems,Avner Friedman,Springer,1993-11-29,"This is the sixth volume in the series ""Mathematics in Industrial Prob lems. "" The motivation for these volumes is to foster interaction between Industry and Mathematics at the ""grass roots level""; that is, at the level of specific problems. These problems come from Industry: they arise from models developed by the industrial scientists in ventures directed at the manufacture of new or improved products. At the same time, these prob lems have the potential for mathematical challenge and novelty. To identify such problems, I have visited industries and had discussions with their scientists. Some of the scientists have subsequently presented their problems in the IMA Seminar on Industrial Problems. The book is based on the seminar presentations and on questions raised in subse quent discussions. Each chapter is devoted to one of the talks and is self contained. The chapters usually provide references to the mathematical literature and a list of open problems which are of interest to the industrial scientists. For some problems a partial solution is indicated briefly. The last chapter of the book contains a short description of solutions to some of the problems raised in previous volumes, as well as references to papers in which such solutions have been published. The speakers in the seminar on Industrial Problems have given us at the IMA hours of delight and discovery.

A Course in Mathematics for Students of Physics: Volume 1,"Paul Bamberg, Shlomo Sternberg",Cambridge University Press,1991-08-30,"This textbook, available in two volumes, has been developed from a course taught at Harvard over the last decade. The course covers principally the theory and physical applications of linear algebra and of the calculus of several variables, particularly the exterior calculus. The authors adopt the 'spiral method' of teaching, covering the same topic several times at increasing levels of sophistication and range of application. Thus the reader develops a deep, intuitive understanding of the subject as a whole, and an appreciation of the natural progression of ideas. Topics covered include many items previously dealt with at a much more advanced level, such as algebraic topology (introduced via the analysis of electrical networks), exterior calculus, Lie derivatives, and star operators (which are applied to Maxwell's equations and optics). This then is a text which breaks new ground in presenting and applying sophisticated mathematics in an elementary setting.

Fostering Collateral Creativity in School Mathematics,"Sergei Abramovich, Viktor Freiman",Springer,2023-10-16,"This book explores the topic of using technology, both physical and digital, to motivate creative mathematical thinking among students who are not considered ‘mathematically advanced.’ The book reflects the authors’ experience of teaching mathematics to Canadian and American teacher candidates and supervising several field-based activities by the candidates. It consists of eight chapters and an Appendix which includes details of constructing computational learning environments. Specifically, the book demonstrates how the appropriate use of technology in the teaching of mathematics can create conditions for the emergence of what may be called ‘collateral creativity,’ a notion similar to Dewey’s notion of collateral learning. Just as collateral learning does not result from the immediate goal of the traditional curriculum, collateral creativity does not result from the immediate goal of traditional problem solving. Rather, mathematical creativity emerges as a collateral outcome of thinking afforded by the use of technology. Furthermore, collateral creativity is an educative outcome of one’s learning experience with pedagogy that motivates students to ask questions about computer-generated or tactile-derived information and assists them in finding answers to their own or the teacher’s questions. This book intends to provide guidance to teachers for fostering collateral creativity in their classrooms.",3031406389,9783031406386,0,Education,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=e2UN0AEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=e2UN0AEACAAJ&dq=Mathematics&hl=&cd=372&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=e2UN0AEACAAJ&dq=Mathematics&hl=&source=gbs_api
