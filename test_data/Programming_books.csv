Computational Intelligence,Christine L. Mumford,Springer Science & Business Media,2009-07-21,"This book is about synergy in computational intelligence (CI). It is a c- lection of chapters that covers a rich and diverse variety of computer-based techniques, all involving some aspect of computational intelligence, but each one taking a somewhat pragmatic view. Many complex problems in the real world require the application of some form of what we loosely call “intel- gence”fortheirsolution. Fewcanbesolvedbythenaiveapplicationofasingle technique, however good it is. Authors in this collection recognize the li- tations of individual paradigms, and propose some practical and novel ways in which di?erent CI techniques can be combined with each other, or with more traditional computational techniques, to produce powerful probl- solving environments which exhibit synergy, i. e. , systems in which the whole 1 is greater than the sum of the parts . Computational intelligence is a relatively new term, and there is some d- agreement as to its precise de?nition. Some practitioners limit its scope to schemes involving evolutionary algorithms, neural networks, fuzzy logic, or hybrids of these. For others, the de?nition is a little more ?exible, and will include paradigms such as Bayesian belief networks, multi-agent systems, case-based reasoning and so on. Generally, the term has a similar meaning to the well-known phrase “Arti?cial Intelligence” (AI), although CI is p- ceived moreas a “bottom up” approachfrom which intelligent behaviour can emerge,whereasAItendstobestudiedfromthe“topdown”,andderivefrom pondering upon the “meaning of intelligence”.

Network Troubleshooting Tools,Joseph D Sloan,"O'Reilly Media, Inc.",2001,"Over the years, thousands of tools have been developed for debugging TCP/IP networks. They range from very specialized tools that do one particular task, to generalized suites that do just about everything except replace bad Ethernet cables. Even better, many of them are absolutely free. There's only one problem: who has time to track them all down, sort through them for the best ones for a particular purpose, or figure out how to use them? Network Troubleshooting Tools does the work for you--by describing the best of the freely available tools for debugging and troubleshooting. You can start with a lesser-known version of ping that diagnoses connectivity problems, or take on a much more comprehensive program like MRTG for graphing traffic through network interfaces. There's tkined for mapping and automatically monitoring networks, and Ethereal for capturing packets and debugging low-level problems. This book isn't just about the tools available for troubleshooting common network problems. It also outlines a systematic approach to network troubleshooting: how to document your network so you know how it behaves under normal conditions, and how to think about problems when they arise, so you can solve them more effectively. The topics covered in this book include: Understanding your network Connectivity testing Evaluating the path between two network nodes Tools for capturing packets Tools for network discovery and mapping Tools for working with SNMP Performance monitoring Testing application layer protocols Software sources If you're involved with network operations, this book will save you time, money, and needless experimentation.",N/A,N/A,376,Computers,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZvFSAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=ZvFSAAAAMAAJ&q=Programming&dq=Programming&hl=&cd=69&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=ZvFSAAAAMAAJ&dq=Programming&hl=&source=gbs_api

Introduction to Scientific Programming with Python,Joakim Sundnes,N/A,2020,"This open access book offers an initial introduction to programming for scientific and computational applications using the Python programming language. The presentation style is compact and example-based, making it suitable for students and researchers with little or no prior experience in programming. The book uses relevant examples from mathematics and the natural sciences to present programming as a practical toolbox that can quickly enable readers to write their own programs for data processing and mathematical modeling. These tools include file reading, plotting, simple text analysis, and using NumPy for numerical computations, which are fundamental building blocks of all programs in data science and computational science. At the same time, readers are introduced to the fundamental concepts of programming, including variables, functions, loops, classes, and object-oriented programming. Accordingly, the book provides a sound basis for further computer science and programming studies.",3030503569,9783030503567,157,Computer programming,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nOPuDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=nOPuDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Programming&hl=&cd=132&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=nOPuDwAAQBAJ&dq=Programming&hl=&source=gbs_api

'C' Programming in an Open Source Paradigm,"K. S. Oza, S. R. Patil, R. K. Kamat",CRC Press,2022-09-01,"Over the period of last few decades, the ‘C’ language has become an icon for computer programmers. The field of computer science has undergone tremendous change, and the rate of obsolescence of concepts, programming platforms, tools and utilities is extremely high. However, in spite of such vast changes, the only thing that has retained its stability is the ‘C’ language. Even today, millions of students, hobbyists and professional programmers enjoy the sturdiness, reliability and user friendliness of the ‘C’ language. Today ‘C’ enjoys the undisputable recognition in the computing paradigm for diversified applications, from the basic programming, microcontrollers, and spreadsheets to system programming. In this book, most of the usual theoretical features have been skipped, for these have been widely published in previous books. Rather than introducing the underpinning theory, the authors approach has been “learning-through-doing”, which is one that often appeals to programmers. Theory is followed by practical implementation, and in this way the book will cover programming aspects in a self-tutor manner providing an excellent overview, from basic to advance programming. Topics discussed include: • GCC interface• First time ‘C’ User• Decision and looping structures• Arrays and pointers• Functions, structures and union• Linear data structures",1000794598,9781000794595,187,Computers,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ofyGEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=ofyGEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Programming&hl=&cd=138&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=ofyGEAAAQBAJ&dq=Programming&hl=&source=gbs_api

Management Information Systems,Effy Oz,N/A,2004,"Management Information Systems, Fourth Edition, is a revision of our highest-level, most strategic, introduction to MIS text. What sets this book apart from others is its managerial focus and its unique case approach. Each of the book's five parts is begun with a Part Case, an extensive business case that engages the reader from the start. This case is then revisited at the start and end of each chapter. This provides a cohesive and real-world environment into which the reader can place all the MIS-related details information they are leaning. This case approach offers a context for the many and varied problems that businesses face everyday, and how information system can provide solutions. These cases are expanded upon and made interactive with the help of the companion Web site that accompanies this text, and gives students the chance to learn more about the cases, delve deeper into more MIS topics and also provide opportunities for more hands on practice.

Democracy and the Problem of Free Speech,Cass R. Sunstein,N/A,1993,"Instead, we should conceive of free speech first and foremost as a means to achieve civic deliberation and true popular sovereignty. Building on James Madison, Sunstein proposes a ""New Deal"" for the first Amendment, a new interpretation that attacks undifferentiated absolutism and replaces it with a vision of responsible public life. Sunstein examines broadcasting, campaign finance, hate speech, pornography, government art funding, commercial speech, and the privacy of rape victims. He insists that political speech, essential for the functioning of any democracy, must not only be protected, but encouraged. If the government, say were to use broadcasting markets to encourage attention to public issues and diverse points of view, the First Amendment would not stand in the way. Nonpolitical speech, on the other hand, should be less fully protected when it conflicts with other interests and rights such as that of privacy.",N/A,N/A,328,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-dwPAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=-dwPAQAAMAAJ&q=Programming&dq=Programming&hl=&cd=148&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=-dwPAQAAMAAJ&dq=Programming&hl=&source=gbs_api

This introductory textbook uses a hands-on approach to teach the principles of programming languages. Using Java as the implementation language, Rajan covers a range of emerging topics, including concurrency, Big Data, and event-driven programming. Students will learn to design, implement, analyze, and understand both domain-specific and general-purpose programming languages. Develops basic concepts in languages, including means of computation, means of combination, and means of abstraction. Examines imperative features such as references, concurrency features such as fork, and reactive features such as event handling. Covers language features that express differing perspectives of thinking about computation, including those of logic programming and flow-based programming. Presumes Java programming experience and understanding of object-oriented classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and static classes.

Computer Programming,"Marvin L. Stein, William D. Munro",N/A,1964,"Computer Programming: A Mixed Language Approach describes computer programming from a mixed language perspective. More specifically, it examines how to make effective use of the hardware and software aspects of the total system using the mixed languages that are a composite of the absolute machine languages and the more facile problem-oriented languages. In addition to the absolute machine language required by the computer ""hardware"" and the problem-oriented language provided by the ""software"" of symbolic assembly programs and compilers, a third kind of programming language is considered, namely, the symbolic machine language. Comprised of nine chapters, this book illustrates mixed language programming using Fortran and the Fortran Symbolic Assembly Program. The discussion begins by describing a modern digital computer and introducing the general theory of number systems. Subsequent chapters focus on the way in which computing machines are organized to perform their functions; how a computer executes the sequence of instructions and performs a given calculation, a process known as coding; and non-arithmetic instructions used on computers. Subroutines, input-output, and assembly of complete programs are also explored. The final chapter is devoted to Fortran and programs written completely in Fortran, as well as executive programs and programs in mixed languages.

Computer Programming in C for Beginners,Avelino J. González,N/A,2020,"This textbook is an ideal introduction in college courses or self-study for learning computer programming using the C language. Written for those with minimal or no programming experience, Computer Programming in C for Beginners offers a heavily guided, hands-on approach that enables the reader to quickly start programming, and then progresses to cover the major concepts of C programming that are critical for an early stage programmer to know and understand. While the progression of topics is conventional, their treatment is innovative and designed for rapid understanding of the many concepts in C that have traditionally proven difficult for beginners, such as variable typing and scope, function definition, passing by value, pointers, passing by reference, arrays, structures, basic memory management, dynamic memory allocation, and linked lists, as well as an introductory treatment of searching and sorting algorithms. Written in an informal but clear narrative, the book uses extensive examples throughout and provides detailed guidance on how to write the C code to achieve the objectives of the example problems. Derived from the author's many years of teaching hands-on college courses, it encourages the reader to follow along by programming the progressively more complex exercise programs presented. In some sections, errors are purposely inserted into the code to teach the reader about the common pitfalls of programming in general, and the C language in particular.",3030507513,9783030507510,0,Computer programming,en,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=iVhezwEACAAJ&dq=Programming&hl=&cd=191&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=iVhezwEACAAJ&dq=Programming&hl=&source=gbs_api

Logic Programming,"I. Balbin, K. Lecot",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Logic Programming was effectively defined as a discipline in the early seventies. It is only during the early to mid eighties that books, conferences and journals devoted entirely to Logic Programming began to appear. Consequently, much of the work done during this first crucial decade in Marseilles, Edinburgh, London, Budapest and Stockholm (to name a few) is often overlooked or difficult to trace. There are now two main regular conferences on Logic Programming, and at least five journals: The Journal of Logic Programming, New Generation Computing, Automated Reasoning, The Journal of SJmbolic Computation, and Future Generation Computer Systems. Logic Programming, however, has its roots in Automated Theorem Proving and via the expanding area of expert systems, strongly influences researchers in such varied fields as Civil Engineering, Chemistry, Law, etc. Consequently, many papers related to Logic Programming appear in a wide variety of journals and proceedings of conferences in other disciplines. This is particularly true of Computer Science where a revolution is taking place in hardware design, programming languages, and more recently databases.

Programming Language Design and Implementation,Torben Ægidius Mogensen,Springer,2022-11-19,"This textbook is intended as a guide for programming-language designers and users to better help them understand consequences of design decisions. The text aims to provide readers with an overview of the design space for programming languages and how design choices affect implementation. It is not a classical compilers book, as it assumes the reader is familiar with basic compiler implementation techniques; nor is it a traditional comparative programming languages book, because it does not go into depth about any particular language, instead taking examples from a wide variety of programming languages to illustrate design concepts. Readers are assumed to already have done at least a bit of programming in functional, imperative, and object-oriented languages. Topics and features: Provides topic-by-topic coverage of syntax, types, scopes, memory management and more Includes many technical exercises and discussion exercises Inspires readers to think about language design choices, how these interact, and how they can be implemented Covers advanced topics such as formal semantics and limits of computation Suitable for advanced undergraduates and beginning graduates, this highly practical and useful textbook/guide will also offer programming language professionals a superb reference and learning toolkit.",3031118057,9783031118050,0,Computers,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=G_I5zwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=G_I5zwEACAAJ&dq=Programming&hl=&cd=214&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=G_I5zwEACAAJ&dq=Programming&hl=&source=gbs_api

"Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python, revised and expanded edition",John V. Guttag,MIT Press,2013-08-09,"An introductory text that teaches students the art of computational problem solving, covering topics that range from simple algorithms to information visualization. This book introduces students with little or no prior programming experience to the art of computational problem solving using Python and various Python libraries, including PyLab. It provides students with skills that will enable them to make productive use of computational techniques, including some of the tools and techniques of “data science” for using computation to model and interpret data. The book is based on an MIT course (which became the most popular course offered through MIT's OpenCourseWare) and was developed for use not only in a conventional classroom but in a massive open online course (or MOOC) offered by the pioneering MIT-Harvard collaboration edX. Students are introduced to Python and the basics of programming in the context of such computational concepts and techniques as exhaustive enumeration, bisection search, and efficient approximation algorithms. The book does not require knowledge of mathematics beyond high school algebra, but does assume that readers are comfortable with rigorous thinking and not intimidated by mathematical concepts. Although it covers such traditional topics as computational complexity and simple algorithms, the book focuses on a wide range of topics not found in most introductory texts, including information visualization, simulations to model randomness, computational techniques to understand data, and statistical techniques that inform (and misinform) as well as two related but relatively advanced topics: optimization problems and dynamic programming. Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python can serve as a stepping-stone to more advanced computer science courses, or as a basic grounding in computational problem solving for students in other disciplines.",0262316668,9780262316668,315,Computers,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=69IyAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=69IyAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Programming&hl=&cd=223&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=69IyAgAAQBAJ&dq=Programming&hl=&source=gbs_api

Programming in Prolog,"William F. Clocksin, Christopher S. Mellish",Springer Science & Business Media,2003-07-25,"Originally published in 1981, this was the first textbook on programming in the Prolog language and is still the definitive introductory text on Prolog. Though many Prolog textbooks have been published since, this one has withstood the test of time because of its comprehensiveness, tutorial approach, and emphasis on general programming applications. Prolog has continued to attract a great deal of interest in the computer science community, and has turned out to be the basis for an important new generation of programming languages and systems for Artificial Intelligence. Since the previous edition of Programming in Prolog, the language has been standardised by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and this book has been updated accordingly. The authors have also introduced some new material, clarified some explanations, corrected a number of minor errors, and removed appendices about Prolog systems that are now obsolete.",3540006788,9783540006787,324,Computers,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VjHk2Cjrti8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,4,3,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=VjHk2Cjrti8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Programming&hl=&cd=225&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=VjHk2Cjrti8C&dq=Programming&hl=&source=gbs_api

Programming in Prolog,"W. F. Clocksin, C. S. Mellish",Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"Since the first publishing of Programming in Prolog in 1981, Pro log has continued to attract an unexpectedly great deal of interest in the computer science community and is now seen as a potential ba sis for an important new generation of programming languages and systems. We hope that Programming in Prolog has partially satisfied the increasing need for an easy, yet comprehensive introduction to the language as a tool for practical programming. In this second edition we have taken the opportunity to improve the presentation and to correct various minor errors in the original. We thank the many people who have given us suggestions for corrections and improvement. W. F. C. C. S. M. Cambridge, England August, 198-1 Preface to the First Edition The computer programming language Prolog is quickly gaining popularity throughout the world. Since its beginnings around 1970, Prolog has been chosen by many programmers for applications of symbolic computation, including: • relational databases • mathematical logic • abstract problem solving • understanding naturallangur~ge • design automation • symbolic equation solving • biochemical structure analysis • many areas of artificial intelligence Until now, there has been no textbook with the aim of teaching Prolog as a practical programming language. It is perhaps a tribute to Prolog that so many people have been motivated to learn it by referring to the necessarily concise reference manuals, a few published papers, and by the orally transmitted 'folklore' of the modern computing community.",3642968732,9783642968730,313,Computers,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=To-qCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,5,1,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=To-qCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Programming&hl=&cd=231&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=To-qCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

An Introduction to Programming in Prolog,Patrick Saint-Dizier,Springer Science & Business Media,2012-12-06,"This book is an introduction to Prolog (£rQgramming in ~ic). It presents the basic foundations of Prolog and basic and fundamental programming methods. This book is written for programmers familiar with other programming languages, as well as for novices in computer science, willing to have an original introduction to programming. The approach adopted in this book is thus based on methodological elements together with some pragmatic aspects. The book is composed of two parts. In the fIrst part the major aspects of programming in Prolog are presented step by step. Each new aspect is illustrated by short examples and exercises. The second part is composed of more developed examples, which are often games, that illustrate major aspects of artifIcial intelligence. More advanced books are given in the bibliography and will allow the reader to deepen his or her know ledge of Prolog. Prolog was first designed in France at OJ.A., Marseille, with a specific syntax. We have adopted here a more common notation, defIned at Edinburgh, which tends to be an implicit norm. At the end of each chapter of the fIrst part, there are exercises that the reader is invited to do and to test on his or her machine.

Build Your Own Programming Language,Clinton L. Jeffery,N/A,2021-12-31,"Written by the creator of the Unicon programming language, this book will show you how to implement programming languages to reduce the time and cost of creating applications for new or specialized areas of computing Key Features: Reduce development time and solve pain points in your application domain by building a custom programming language Learn how to create parsers, code generators, file readers, analyzers, and interpreters Create an alternative to frameworks and libraries to solve domain-specific problems Book Description: The need for different types of computer languages is growing rapidly and developers prefer creating domain-specific languages for solving specific application domain problems. Building your own programming language has its advantages. It can be your antidote to the ever-increasing size and complexity of software. However, creating a custom language isn't easy. In this book, you'll be able to put the knowledge you gain to work in language design and implementation. You'll implement the frontend of a compiler for your language, including a lexical analyzer and parser. The book covers a series of traversals of syntax trees, culminating with code generation for a bytecode virtual machine. Moving ahead, you'll learn how domain-specific language (DSL) features are often best represented by operators and functions that are built into the language, rather than library functions. The book concludes by showing you how to implement garbage collection, including reference counting and mark-and-sweep garbage collection. Throughout the book, Dr. Jeffery weaves in his experience of building the Unicon programming language to give better context to the concepts, while providing relevant examples in Unicon and Java. By the end of this book, you'll be able to build and deploy your own domain-specific languages, capable of compiling and running programs. What You Will Learn: Perform requirements analysis for the new language and design language syntax and semantics Write lexical and context-free grammar rules for common expressions and control structures Develop a scanner that reads source code and generate a parser that checks syntax Build key data structures in a compiler and use your compiler to build a syntax-coloring code editor Implement a bytecode interpreter and run bytecode generated by your compiler Write tree traversals that insert information into the syntax tree Implement garbage collection in your language Who this book is for: This book is for software developers interested in the idea of inventing their own language or developing a domain-specific language. Computer science students taking compiler construction courses will also find this book highly useful as a practical guide to language implementation to supplement more theoretical textbooks. Intermediate-level knowledge and experience working with a high-level language such as Java or the C++ language are expected to help you get the most out of this book.",1800204809,9781800204805,494,Programming languages (Electronic computers),en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LDiizgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=LDiizgEACAAJ&dq=Programming&hl=&cd=255&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=LDiizgEACAAJ&dq=Programming&hl=&source=gbs_api

Neveltheless, an introductory chapter is included for the benefit of the beginner, displaying in a concise form some of the fundamental concepts of computers and their programming. The text is therefore also suitable as a self-contained tutorial. The notation used is Modula-2, which lends itself well for a structured approach and leads the student to a working style that has generally become known under the title of structured programming. As a manual for programming in Modula-2, the text covers practically all facilities of that language. Part 1 covers the basic notions of the variable, expression, assignment, conditional and repetitive statement, and array data structure. Together with Palt 2 which introduces the important concept of the procedure or subroutine, it contains essentially the material commonly discussed in introductory programming courses. Part 3 concerns data types and structures and constitutes the essence of an advanced course on programming. Palt 4 introduces the notion of the module, a concept that is fundamental to the design of larger programmed systems and to programming as team work. The most commonly used utility programs for input and output are presented as examples of modules.",3642835651,9783642835650,184,Computers,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ncioCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=ncioCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Programming&hl=&cd=258&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ncioCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Core Techniques and Algorithms in Game Programming,Daniel Sánchez-Crespo Dalmau,New Riders,2004,"To even try to keep pace with the rapid evolution of game development, you need a strong foundation in core programming techniques-not a hefty volume on one narrow topic or one that devotes itself to API-specific implementations. Finally, there's a guide that delivers! As a professor at the Spanish university that offered that country's first master's degree in video game creation, author Daniel Sanchez-Crespo recognizes that there's a core programming curriculum every game designer should be well versed in-and he's outlined it in these pages! By focusing on time-tested coding techniques-and providing code samples that use C++, and the OpenGL and DirectX APIs-Daniel has produced a guide whose shelf life will extend long beyond the latest industry trend. Code design, data structures, design patterns, AI, scripting engines, 3D pipelines, texture mapping, and more: They're all covered here-in clear, coherent fashion and with a focus on the essentials that will have you referring back to this volume for years to come.",0131020099,9780131020092,892,Computers,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1hwR5gIq0I8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,5,1,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=1hwR5gIq0I8C&dq=Programming&hl=&cd=261&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=1hwR5gIq0I8C&dq=Programming&hl=&source=gbs_api

Practical C Programming,B. M. Harwani,N/A,2020-02-14,"A comprehensive guide with practical instructions for learning data structures, low-level programming, high-performance computing, networking and IoT to help you understand the latest standards in C programming such as C11 and C18 Key Features Tackle various challenges in C programming by making the most of its latest features Understand the workings of arrays, strings, functions, pointers, advanced data structures, and algorithms Become well-versed with process synchronization during multitasking and server-client process communication Book Description Used in everything from microcontrollers to operating systems, C is a popular programming language among developers because of its flexibility and versatility. This book helps you get hands-on with various tasks, covering the fundamental as well as complex C programming concepts that are essential for making real-life applications. You'll start with recipes for arrays, strings, user-defined functions, and pre-processing directives. Once you're familiar with the basic features, you'll gradually move on to learning pointers, file handling, concurrency, networking, and inter-process communication (IPC).

Game Programming with Unity and C#,Casey Hardman,Apress,2020-06-13,"​Designed for beginners with no knowledge or experience in game development or programming, this book teaches the essentials of the Unity game engine, the C# programming language, and the art of object-oriented programming. New concepts are not only explained, but thoroughly demonstrated. Starting with an introduction to Unity, you'll learn about scenes, GameObjects, prefabs, components, and how to use the various windows to interact with the engine. You'll then dive into the fundamentals of programming by reviewing syntax rules, formatting, methods, variables, objects and types, classes, and inheritance, all while getting your hands dirty writing and testing code yourself. Later, the book explains how to expose script data in the Inspector and the basics of Unity’s serialization system. This carefully crafted work guides you through the planning and development of bare bones, simple game projects designed to exercise programming concepts while keeping less relevant interruptions out of the way, allowing you to focus on the implementation of game mechanics first and foremost. Through these example projects, the book teaches input handling, rigidbodies, colliders, cameras, prefab instantiation, scene loading, user interface design and coding, and more. By the end, you'll have built a solid foundation in programming that will pave your way forward in understanding core C# syntax and fundamentals of object-oriented programming—not just what to type but why it's typed and what it’s really doing. Game Programming with Unity and C# will send you on your way to becoming comfortable with the Unity game engine and its documentation and how to independently seek further information on yet-untouched concepts and challenges.

Introduction to the Theory of Programming Languages,"Gilles Dowek, Jean-Jacques Lévy",Springer,2011-04-08,"The design and implementation of programming languages, from Fortran and Cobol to Caml and Java, has been one of the key developments in the management of ever more complex computerized systems. Introduction to the Theory of Programming Languages gives the reader the means to discover the tools to think, design, and implement these languages. It proposes a unified vision of the different formalisms that permit definition of a programming language: small steps operational semantics, big steps operational semantics, and denotational semantics, emphasising that all seek to define a relation between three objects: a program, an input value, and an output value. These formalisms are illustrated by presenting the semantics of some typical features of programming languages: functions, recursivity, assignments, records, objects, ... showing that the study of programming languages does not consist of studying languages one after another, but is organized around the features that are present in these various languages. The study of these features leads to the development of evaluators, interpreters and compilers, and also type inference algorithms, for small languages.",0857290770,9780857290779,96,Computers,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YZ__sgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=YZ__sgEACAAJ&dq=Programming&hl=&cd=297&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=YZ__sgEACAAJ&dq=Programming&hl=&source=gbs_api

Computer Programming,"Zack Fleming, Steven Webber",N/A,2019-02-16,"Description Inside, you will find an introduction to JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and SQL. These are computer programming languages. Some of them are more precisely referred to as scripting languages. Starting with JavaScript, I will introduce you to the above-mentioned programming languages. Hopefully, by the end of this book, you will have the answers to the questions of what it is and what you can do with it. JavaScript is a programming language that allows for the implementation of complex items on static web pages. Every time you look at a web page that does something besides display static information, it is a pretty safe assumption to make that JavaScript is involved. It is often referred to as the third layer of the cake. HTML is a relatively simple programming language that, at its core, consists of elements. These elements allow you to distinguish different sections of text as different aspects on your page. Whether it be a paragraph, a heading, a column, or whatever you need it to be--this is accomplished with the use of these elements. This language is also where you get the ability to create hyperlinks. The use of hyperlinks is very important, especially when you want to be able to direct someone to a specific part of your text or page. CSS is a programming language that is used to style and structure the layout of a web page. If you want to change your font, color, and background, you may do so by adding an animation or design a specific outline. This is the language you're going to make use of to accomplish those things. CSS makes use of the box model--most elements are represented as a box with the content, padding, and borders built-up like layers on an onion. You need to understand the box model before you can begin to understand how to create CSS layouts. Meanwhile, SQL is a programming language that is designed to work with sets of facts and how they relate to each other. As you might expect, relational database programs make use of SQL. Like many other computer languages, SQL is, in fact, an international standard. However, SQL is easily read and understood even by beginners. Data sets are described in SQL using SELECT statements. An SQL statement is like a sentence and consists of clauses. Some clauses are required in a SELECT statement.",1393575692,9781393575696,94,N/A,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=c8fyzQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=c8fyzQEACAAJ&dq=Programming&hl=&cd=307&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=c8fyzQEACAAJ&dq=Programming&hl=&source=gbs_api

Learning C# by Programming Games,"Arjan Egges, Jeroen D. Fokker, Mark H. Overmars",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-06-06,"Developing computer games is a perfect way to learn how to program in modern programming languages. This book teaches how to program in C# through the creation of computer games – and without requiring any previous programming experience. Contrary to most programming books, Egges, Fokker and Overmars do not organize the presentation according to programming language constructs, but instead use the structure and elements of computer games as a framework. For instance, there are chapters on dealing with player input, game objects, game worlds, game states, levels, animation, physics, and intelligence. The reader will be guided through the development of four games showing the various aspects of game development. Starting with a simple shooting game, the authors move on to puzzle games consisting of multiple levels, and conclude the book by developing a full-fledged platform game with animation, game physics, and intelligent enemies. They show a number of commonly used techniques in games, such as drawing layers of sprites, rotating, scaling and animating sprites, showing a heads-up display, dealing with physics, handling interaction between game objects, and creating pleasing visual effects such as snow or glitter. At the same time, they provide a thorough introduction to C# and object-oriented programming, introducing step by step important aspects of programming in general, including many programming constructs and idioms, syntax diagrams, collections, and exception handling. The book is also designed to be used as a basis for a game-oriented programming course. For each part, there are concluding exercises and challenges, which are generally more complex programming endeavors. Lots of supplementary materials for organizing such a course are available on the accompanying web site http://www.csharpprogramminggames.com, including installation instructions, solutions to the exercises, software installation instructions, game sprites and sounds.",3642365809,9783642365805,449,Computers,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TWFIAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=TWFIAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Programming&hl=&cd=309&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TWFIAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Your Wish is My Command,Henry Lieberman,Elsevier,2001-03-12,"As user interface designers, software developers, and yes-as users, we all know the frustration that comes with using ""one size fits all"" software from off the shelf. Repeating the same commands over and over again, putting up with an unfriendly graphical interface, being unable to program a new application that you thought of yourself-these are all common complaints. The inflexibility of today's computer interfaces makes many people feel like they are slaves to their computers. Shouldn't it be the other way around? Why can't technology give us more ""custom-fitting"" software? On the horizon is a new technology that promises to give ordinary users the power to create and modify their own programs. Programming by example (PBE) is a technique in which a software agent records a user's behavior in an interactive graphical interface, then automatically writes a program that will perform that behavior for the user. Your Wish is My Command: Programming by Example takes a broad look at this new technology. In these nineteen chapters, programming experts describe implemented systems showing that PBE can work in a wide variety of application fields. They include the following: The renowned authors and their editor believe that PBE will some day make it possible for interfaces to effectively say to the user, ""Your wish is my command!"" - Text and graphical editing - Web browsing - Computer-aided design - Teaching programming to children - Programming computer games - Geographical information systems",0080521452,9780080521459,443,Computers,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=a_kdwtoIAx4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=a_kdwtoIAx4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Programming&hl=&cd=317&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=a_kdwtoIAx4C&source=gbs_api

Studying Programming,Sally Fincher,Bloomsbury Publishing,2006-02-13,"We've written this book to support students in studying programming. It is not a text to teach any particular programming language, but to be used alongside such a book, or in conjunction with a taught course. In Studying Programming we concentrate on what other books consider too 'obvious' or too 'basic'. We explain the ideas that others assume you know, we describe the things that can make learning to program a frustrating experience if you don't know them. We stay with you through the process from starting with your very first blank screen to working on complex problems within a team. Studying Programming has been written by 9 members of the Computing Education Research Group at the University of Kent. All of us are practicing computing academics who also have a research interest in CS education. So we have a strong classroom background - teaching students on a daily basis - and a strong research background, knowing what has been investigated (and written on) with regard to students' knowledge, conception and difficulties in introductory programming.",135031496X,9781350314962,187,Study Aids,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=a_NGEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=a_NGEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Programming&hl=&cd=334&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=a_NGEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api

Design Concepts in Programming Languages,"Franklyn Turbak, David Gifford",MIT Press,2008-07-18,"Key ideas in programming language design and implementation explained using a simple and concise framework; a comprehensive introduction suitable for use as a textbook or a reference for researchers. Hundreds of programming languages are in use today—scripting languages for Internet commerce, user interface programming tools, spreadsheet macros, page format specification languages, and many others. Designing a programming language is a metaprogramming activity that bears certain similarities to programming in a regular language, with clarity and simplicity even more important than in ordinary programming. This comprehensive text uses a simple and concise framework to teach key ideas in programming language design and implementation. The book's unique approach is based on a family of syntactically simple pedagogical languages that allow students to explore programming language concepts systematically. It takes as premise and starting point the idea that when language behaviors become incredibly complex, the description of the behaviors must be incredibly simple. The book presents a set of tools (a mathematical metalanguage, abstract syntax, operational and denotational semantics) and uses it to explore a comprehensive set of programming language design dimensions, including dynamic semantics (naming, state, control, data), static semantics (types, type reconstruction, polymporphism, effects), and pragmatics (compilation, garbage collection). The many examples and exercises offer students opportunities to apply the foundational ideas explained in the text. Specialized topics and code that implements many of the algorithms and compilation methods in the book can be found on the book's Web site, along with such additional material as a section on concurrency and proofs of the theorems in the text.

What You Will Learn Learn about Modular Programming and what modules an enterprise application can be divided into. Set up a development environment and create a ""Hello World"" application. Start implementing a sample application from the presentation layer. Implement the persistence layer. Implement the business layer, wrapping up all of the modules with Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI). Manage an application's life cycle. Learn how to secure Web applications. Test enterprise applications and their automation. Understand how to version source code using Source Code Management (SCM) systems such as GIT and SVN. In Detail Modular programming means dividing an application into small parts and then developing it. It is an approach taken by developers to build applications and helps them add efficiency in their development process, thus making it more effective. The book starts with the fundamentals of Modular Programming. Then we move on to the actual implementation, where we teach developers how to divide an application into different modules or layers (such as presentation, execution, security, lifecycle, services, and so on) for better management. Once readers are well-versed in these modules and their development, the book shows how to create bindings in order to join these different modules and form a complete application. Next, the readers will learn how to manage these modules through dependency injection. Later, we move on to testing; readers will learn how to test the different modules of an application. The book ends by teaching readers how to maintain different versions of their application and how to modify it. By the end of the book, readers will have a good understanding of modular programming and will be able to use it to build applications with Java. Style and approach This book is a practical guide to help readers learn Modular Programming with Java and build an enterprise-ready app along the way. The book is divided into three major sections.

Novice Programming Environments,"Marc Eisenstadt, Mark T. Keane, Tim Rajan",Routledge,2018-05-14,"This book, originally published in 1992, encapsulates ten years of research at the Open University¿s Human Cognition Research Laboratory. The research investigates the problems of novice programmers, and is strongly oriented toward the design and implementation of ""programming environments"" aimed at eliminating or easing novices¿ problems. A range of languages is studied: Pascal, SOLO, Lisp, Prolog and ""Knowledge Engineering Programming"". The primary emphasis of the empirical studies is to gain some understanding of novices¿ ""mental models"" of the inner workings of computers. Such (erroneous) models are constructed by novices in their own heads to account for the idiosyncrasies of particular programming languages. The primary emphasis of the implementations described in the book is the provision of ""automatic debugging aids"", i.e. artificial intelligence programs which can analyse novices¿ buggy programs, and make sense of them, thereby providing useful advice for the novices. Another related strand taken in some of the work is the concept of ""pre-emptive design"", i.e. the provision of tools such as syntax-directed editors and graphical tracers which help programmers avoid many frequently-occurring errors. A common thread throughout the book is its Cognitive Science/Artificial Intelligence orientation. AI tools are used, for instance, to construct simulation models of subjects writing programs, in order to provide insights into what their deep conceptual errors are. At the other extreme, AI programs which were developed in order to help student debug their programs are observed empirically in order to ensure that they provide facilities actually needed by real programmers. This book will be of great interest to advanced undergraduate, postgraduate, and professional researchers in Cognitive Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Human-Computer Interaction.",0815351623,9780815351627,360,N/A,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DshfswEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=DshfswEACAAJ&dq=Programming&hl=&cd=389&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=DshfswEACAAJ&dq=Programming&hl=&source=gbs_api

Visual C# Express for Kids,"Philip Conrod, Lou Tylee",Kidware Software,2013-02,"VISUAL C# EXPRESS FOR KIDS is a beginning programming tutorial consisting of 10 chapters explaining (in simple, easy-to-follow terms) how to build a Visual C# Express Windows application. Students learn about project design, the Visual C# Express toolbox, and many elements of the C# language. Numerous examples are used to demonstrate every step in the building process. The tutorial also includes several detailed computer projects for students to build and try. These projects include a number guessing game, a card game, an allowance calculator, a drawing program, a state capitals game, Tic-Tac-Toe and even a simple video game. VISUAL C# EXPRESS FOR KIDS is presented using a combination of over 450 pages of FULL-COLOR notes and actual Visual C# examples. This teacher or parent facilitated material should be understandable to kids aged 10 and up. No programming experience is necessary, but familiarity with doing common tasks using a computer operating system (simple editing, file maintenance, understanding directory structures, working on the Internet) is expected. VISUAL C# EXPRESS FOR KIDS requires Windows 7 or Windows 8 and Visual C# 2012 Express. The Visual C# source code and all needed multimedia files are available for download from the publisher's website (www.KidwareSoftware.com) after book registration. TEACHER REVIEW ""These lessons are a highly organized and well-indexed set of tutorials in the Visual C# programming environment meant for children aged 10 and above. Every computer science teacher knows what a great deal of work is required for projects to work, and with these tutorials, the work is done by an author who understands the classroom and parenting experience. That is extremely rare! The tutorials provide the benefit of completed age-appropriate applications for children - fully documented projects from the teacher's or parents' point of view. It is a great testament to the authors that they are successful in achieving such levels of engagement with consistency. By using these lessons, I am able to spend time on things which will pay off in the classroom. With the Kidware Software products, you have at your disposal a series of projects which will allow you to pick and choose from among those which best suit your curriculum needs. Nothing is forgotten. Students focus upon design stages and sound problem-solving techniques from a computer-science, problem-solving perspective. In doing so, they become independent problem-solvers, and will exceed the curricular requirements of Middle Schools everywhere. There is a high degree of care taken so that projects are age-appropriate. Even an adult novice could make use of the accompanying lessons. The time savings for parents, teachers and students is enormous. Highly organized reference materials encourage student self-study! Having used Kidware Software tutorials for the past decade, I have to say that I could not have achieved the level of success which is now applied in the variety of many programming environments which are currently of considerable interest to kids! I thank Kidware Software and its authors for continuing to stand up for what is right in the teaching methodologies which work with kids - even today's kids where competition for their attention is now so much an issue."" - Alan Payne, Computer Science Teacher, T.A.

The Rust Programming Language,"Steve Klabnik, Carol Nichols",No Starch Press,2018-07-10,"The Rust Programming Language is the official book on Rust, an open-source, community-developed systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. This is the undisputed go-to guide to Rust, written by two members of the Rust core team, with feedback and contributions from 42 members of the community. The book assumes that you’ve written code in another programming language but makes no assumptions about which one, meaning the material is accessible and useful to developers from a wide variety of programming backgrounds. Known by the Rust community as “The Book,” The Rust Programming Language includes concept chapters, where you’ll learn about a particular aspect of Rust, and project chapters, where you’ll apply what you’ve learned so far to build small programs. The Book opens with a quick hands-on project to introduce the basics then explores key concepts in depth, such as ownership, the type system, error handling, and fearless concurrency. Next come detailed explanations of Rust-oriented perspectives on topics like pattern matching, iterators, and smart pointers, with concrete examples and exercises--taking you from theory to practice. The Rust Programming Language will also show you how to: - Grasp important concepts unique to Rust, like ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes - Use Cargo, Rust’s built-in package manager, to build and maintain your code, including downloading and building dependencies - Effectively use Rust’s zero-cost abstractions and employ your own You’ll learn to develop reliable code that’s speed and memory efficient, while avoiding the infamous and arcane programming pitfalls common at the systems level. When you need to dive down into lower-level control, this guide will show you how without taking on the customary risk of crashes or security holes and without requiring you to learn the fine points of a fickle toolchain. You’ll also learn how to create command line programs, build single- and multithreaded web servers, and much more. The Rust Programming Language fully embraces Rust’s potential to empower its users. This friendly and approachable guide will help you build not only your knowledge of Rust but also your ability to program with confidence in a wider variety of domains.",1593278519,9781593278519,553,Computers,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lrgrDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,5,1,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=lrgrDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Programming&hl=&cd=396&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=lrgrDwAAQBAJ&dq=Programming&hl=&source=gbs_api

Object-oriented Concurrent Programming,"Akinori Yonezawa, Mario Tokoro",N/A,1987,"This book deals with a major theme of the Japanese Fifth Generation Project, which emphasizes logic programming, parallelism, and distributed systems. It presents a collection of tutorials and research papers on a new programming and design methodology in which the system to be constructed is modeled as a collection of abstract entities called ""objects"" and concurrent messages passing among objects. This methodology is particularly powerful in exploiting as well as harnessing the parallelism that is naturally found in problem domains. The book includes several proposals for programming languages that support this methodology, as well as the applications of object-oriented concurrent programming to such diverse areas as artificial intelligence, software engineering, music synthesis, office information systems, and system programming. It is the first compilation of research results in this rapidly emerging area. Contents:Concurrent Programming Using Actors. Concurrent Object-Oriented Programming in Act-1.

Beginning Ada Programming,Andrew T. Shvets,Apress,2019-12-09,"Discover the Ada programming language by being gently guided through the various parts of the language and its latest available stable release. The goal in this book is to slowly ease you into the different topics. It is understood that you do not always have ample free time, so the text is easy to digest and concepts are spoon fed to the reader. Starting with the simplest of topics, detailed explanations demonstrate the how and why of Ada. You are strongly encouraged to experiment and break things (without which the learning process is linear and quite dull). At the end of Beginning Ada Programming, you will have an excellent understanding of the general topics that make up the Ada programming language and can tackle far more challenging topics. Each chapter builds on what was previously described. Furthermore, each code example is independent of others and will run all by itself. Instructions are provided where you can obtain an Ada compiler and how to debug your code.

Novice Programming Environments,"Marc Eisenstadt, Mark T. Keane, Tim Rajan",N/A,2018,"""This book, originally published in 1992, encapsulates ten years of research at the Open Universitys Human Cognition Research Laboratory. The research investigates the problems of novice programmers, and is strongly oriented toward the design and implementation of ""programming environments"" aimed at eliminating or easing novices problems. A range of languages is studied: Pascal, SOLO, Lisp, Prolog and ""Knowledge Engineering Programming"". The primary emphasis of the empirical studies is to gain some understanding of novices ""mental models"" of the inner workings of computers. Such (erroneous) models are constructed by novices in their own heads to account for the idiosyncrasies of particular programming languages. The primary emphasis of the implementations described in the book is the provision of ""automatic debugging aids"", i.e. artificial intelligence programs which can analyse novices buggy programs, and make sense of them, thereby providing useful advice for the novices. Another related strand taken in some of the work is the concept of ""pre-emptive design"", i.e. the provision of tools such as syntax-directed editors and graphical tracers which help programmers avoid many frequently-occurring errors. A common thread throughout the book is its Cognitive Science/Artificial Intelligence orientation. AI tools are used, for instance, to construct simulation models of subjects writing programs, in order to provide insights into what their deep conceptual errors are. At the other extreme, AI programs which were developed in order to help student debug their programs are observed empirically in order to ensure that they provide facilities actually needed by real programmers.

Object-Oriented Database Programming,Suad Alagic,Springer,2011-09-16,"The major topic of this book is the integration of data and programming languages and the associated methodologies. To my knowledge, this is the first book on modern programming languages and programming meth odology devoted entirely to database application environments. At the same time, it is written with the goal of reconciling the relational and object-oriented approaches to database management. One of the reasons that influenced my decision to write this book is my dissatisfaction with the fact that the existing books on programming methodology and the associated concepts, techniques, and programming language notation are largely based on mathematical problems and math ematically oriented algorithms. As such, they give the impression that modern program structures, associated techniques, and methodologies, not to speak of the formal ones, are applicable only to problems of that sort. Although important, such problems are of limited applicability and scale. This does not apply to books in which modem concepts, techniques, methodologies, and programming language notation are applied to systems programming. But, even so, this does not demonstrate that in entirely application-oriented problems-those in which modern computer tech nology is most widely used-modern programming methodology is just as important. This book is meant to be a step toward providing a more convincing support of such a claim and, thus, is based entirely on common, what one might call business-oriented, problems in which database technology has been successfully used.",1461281377,9781461281375,320,Computers,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9oRzMAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=9oRzMAEACAAJ&dq=Programming&hl=&cd=419&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=9oRzMAEACAAJ&dq=Programming&hl=&source=gbs_api

Multiparadigm Constraint Programming Languages,Petra Hofstedt,Springer,2011-06-17,"Programming languages are often classified according to their paradigms, e.g. imperative, functional, logic, constraint-based, object-oriented, or aspect-oriented. A paradigm characterizes the style, concepts, and methods of the language for describing situations and processes and for solving problems, and each paradigm serves best for programming in particular application areas. Real-world problems, however, are often best implemented by a combination of concepts from different paradigms, because they comprise aspects from several realms, and this combination is more comfortably realized using multiparadigm programming languages. This book deals with the theory and practice of multiparadigm constraint programming languages. The author first elaborates on programming paradigms and languages, constraints, and the merging of programming concepts which yields multiparadigm (constraint) programming languages. In the second part the author inspects two concrete approaches on multiparadigm constraint programming – the concurrent constraint functional language CCFL, which combines the functional and the constraint-based paradigms and allows the description of concurrent processes; and a general framework for multiparadigm constraint programming and its implementation, Meta-S.

He will be inƯ formed about the optimal solution, about the structure of the problem in the neighbourhood of the solution, and, in addition, about the usage of the corresp, onding FORTRAN subroutines if he is interested in obtaining them -ofi a magnetic tape. Chapter I shows how the test examples are documented. In parƯ ticular, the evaluation of computable information about the soluƯ tion of a problem is outlined. It is explained how the optimal solution, the optimal Lagrange-multipliers, and the condition number of the projected Hessian of the Lagrangian are obtained. Furthermore, a classification number is defined allowing a formal description of a test problem, and the documentation scheme is described which is used in Chapter IV to present the problems.",N/A,N/A,196,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dBtOAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=dBtOAQAAIAAJ&q=Programming&dq=Programming&hl=&cd=441&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.co.th/books?id=dBtOAQAAIAAJ&dq=Programming&hl=&source=gbs_api

The name Scala is derived from Sca(lable) La(nguage). Scala is a multi-paradigm language, incorporating object oriented approaches with functional programming. Although some familiarity with standard computing concepts is assumed (such as the idea of compiling a program and executing this compiled from etc.) and with basic procedural language concepts (such as variables and allocation of values to these variables) the early chapters of the book do not assume any familiarity with object orientation nor with functional programming These chapters also step through other concepts with which the reader may not be familiar (such as list processing). From this background, the book provides a practical introduction to both object and functional approaches using Scala.

In only a few years, many standard software products will be based on concepts of parallel programming implemented on such hardware, and the range of applications will be much broader than that of scientific computing, up to now the main application area for parallel computing. Rauber and Rünger take up these recent developments in processor architecture by giving detailed descriptions of parallel programming techniques that are necessary for developing efficient programs for multicore processors as well as for parallel cluster systems and supercomputers. Their book is structured in three main parts, covering all areas of parallel computing: the architecture of parallel systems, parallel programming models and environments, and the implementation of efficient application algorithms. The emphasis lies on parallel programming techniques needed for different architectures. The main goal of the book is to present parallel programming techniques that can be used in many situations for many application areas and which enable the reader to develop correct and efficient parallel programs. Many examples and exercises are provided to show how to apply the techniques. The book can be used as both a textbook for students and a reference book for professionals.
